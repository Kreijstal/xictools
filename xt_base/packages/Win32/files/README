gtk2-bundle-2.24.25
-------------------
June 27, 2016

The only change is to make the MS-Windows theme the default.  All
components are still current with win-builds.


April 25, 2015

This is a bundle containing the gtk+-2.0 graphical toolkit and its
dependencies for Windows, similar to the gtk2-bundle available from
gtk.org.

This bundle provides more recent components that the current gtk.org
bundle.

The content is retrieved from packages generated from the win-builds
project (http://win-builds.org).  The following packages are included:

This was created by Whiteley Research Inc.  (wrcad.com) to support the
Windows versions of the Xic and WRspice products, but use is
unrestricted by Whiteley Research.

Both run-time and developer files are included.

This bundle is intended for software developers and packagers.  You
are expected to know what to do with it, more or less.

If you want to use the bundle for development work, then add the bin
folder to your PATH.  Make sure you have no other versions of GTK+ in
PATH.  Run:

    pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0

and verify that it prints out something reasonable. Run:

    gtk-demo

and verify that it works.

To use the MS-Windows theme engine, modify the file etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
to contain the line:

    gtk-theme-name = "MS-Windows"

The existing line can be commented out with '#'.
(This has already been done in the present release.)
