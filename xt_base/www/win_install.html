Microsoft Windows Installation, Updating, and Removal</font>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
The <i>XicTools</i> for Windows are supported on Windows 10 and 11.
They should run on Windows 8.1 and maybe 8.0 and 7, but I have no
hardware to test this, or to diagnose/fix any problems.

<p>
The programs retain the "look and feel" of the Linux versions as much
as possible, given the constraints of the Windows operating system. 
The programs use the GTK2 or QT6  graphical interface toolkits, as used
by the other releases.

The graphical and other support libraries are now supplied by installing and
running the programs under the <i>MSYS2</i> environment, which must be
installed.  Previous releases used a "<tt>gtk2_bundle</tt>" to provide
this support, which is no longer required.  <i>MSYS2</i> is a
Linux-like environment similar to <i>Cygwin</i>.

<p>
The distribution files are self-extracting executable archives, as is
common for Windows.  Simply execute the file, and a familiar install
wizard will appear, guiding you through the process.  Executing the
distribution file will either update an existing installation, or
install a new installation.  When updating, the previous release will
be saved using the <a href="/installer.html"><b>Safe Install</b></a>
format.  The <b>Safe Install</b> feature, available with Windows
starting with 4.3 releases, allows easy reversion to the earlier
installation after an update, if needed.

<p>
However, Win32 packages will not be updated by MINGW packages, and may
be installed in the same location, causing file conflicts.

<p>
WARNING<br>
If you have Win32 <i>XicTools</i> programs installed, it is strongly
recommended to manually uninstall the Win32 programs, including the
<tt>gtk2_bundle</tt> before installing the MINGW packages.

<p>
Programs are uninstalled with the <b>Settings</b> (gear-shaped icon) in
the <b>Start</b> window, select <b>Apps</b> and scroll down to the
program to uninstall.  Click on the program icon and follow directions
to uninstall.  Note, this location varies in different Windows versions.

<p>
<b>Registry Usage Warning</b><br>

<p>
The programs use an entry in the Windows Registry to find their
startup files, etc.  This entry is created by the installer program. 
Thus:

<ol>
<li>
<b>Never copy installation directories to a different location and expect
things to work!</b> They won't!

<p>
The correct way to move an existing installation to another location
is to uninstall the program, then reinstall to the new location using
the standard distribution file.  If you simply copy the files to a new
location, the Registry won't be updated and the program won't run
correctly.

<li>You can not simply copy files from another machine when creating a
new installation.  The files must be installed through the
distribution ("<tt>.exe</tt>") files, or the Registry entry won't be
set.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Installation location</b><br>

<p>
The programs are installed by default under <tt>C:\usr\local</tt>,
which will be created if necessary.  The structure of the tree is
very similar to that under Linux, which simplifies compatibility.
All executables will be found in <tt>C:\uer\local\xictools\bin</tt>.

<p>
Although the installation program allows the user to specify an
alternative location for the installation, and an alternative name for
the program group, life will be simpler if the defaults are selected. 
In particular, installing in a place like <tt>C:\Program Files</tt>,
with the space-containing path, will provide a guaranteed migraine.

<p>
<b>Selecting GTK2 or QT6 graphics</b>

<p>
Presently, two sets of executable files are provided in the packages, one
that calls the GTK2 graphical toolkit, and one that calls Qt6.  Operation
is very similar if not identical, though there are cosmetic differences and
some other subtle differences.  Qt will eventually replace GTK2, but for
now GTK2 is kept for comparison purposes and as a backup if there is
trouble.

<p>
If you do nothing, the GTK2 programs are run.  To run the Qt6 versions
instead, you will need to create a one-line file.  This file is named
"<tt>.xtrc</tt>" and exists in your home directory, or the currrent
directory.  You can create this file using the vim editor that was
installed.

<p>
The text in the <tt>.xtrc</tt> file is
<blockquote>
{\vt grpref=QT6}
</blockquote>
to set the choice to Qt6.  To revert to GTK2 one can change the "<tt>QT6</tt>"
to "<tt>GTK2</tt>", or comment the line by inserting a '<tt>#</tt>'
charcter at the beginning.

<p>
<b>Installing <i>MSYS2</i></b>

<p>
Starting January 2021, all Windows binaries are 64-bit, compiled under
the MINGW64 subsystem of <i>MSYS2</i> (64-bit version).

<p>
Although it may be possible to run the programs from other MINGW64
installations, for example <i>Cygwin</i>, it is recommended
<i>MSYS2</i> be installed.  This replaces the <tt>gtk_bundle</tt>
package that was previously used to supply graphical interface dlls.

<p>
When installing <i>MSYS2</i> and <i>XicTools</i> programs, you are
strongly advised to install in the default locations if possible.

<p>
Go to <a href="https://www.msys2.org"><tt>www.msys2.org</tt></a>.  Download
and run the installer, and follow the directions.  It is easy.  When
done, you will have a shell window on the screen.  You should type the
following commands to load some things you'll need.

<blockquote><tt>
pacman -S vim<br>
pacman -S winpty<br>
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gsl<br>
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk2<br>
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
This provides the <tt>vim</tt> editor, the <tt>winpty</tt> program
described below, the GTK2 and QT6 libraries and dependencies, and the Gnu
Scientific Library.  These satisfy all references needed to run the
<i>XicTools</i> programs.

<p>
Then, use the <tt>vim</tt> editor to edit the <tt>.bash_profile</tt>
file that exists in the current (your home) directory.  Add the
following lines to the bottom of the file:

<blockquote><tt>
mount c:/usr/local/xictools /usr/local/xictools<br>
export PATH="/usr/local/xictools/bin:$PATH"<br>
export XT_HOMEDIR=c:/msys64/home/<i>your_username</i>
</tt></blockquote>

<b>To run the programs in the future:</b><br>
Click <b>MSYS2 64bit</b> in the <b>Start</b> menu, then <b>MSYS2 MinGW
x64</b> in the sub-menu.  This brings up a shell window with the MinGW
64-bit support enabled.  Note that there are multiple choices in the
sub-menu so be sure to select the one specified, others may not work
with the <i>XicTools</i> programs.

<p>
Take some time to learn about <i>MSYS2</i> and MINGW64, particularly
the <tt>pacman</tt> package manager.  You can install lots of useful
software that runs in this environment.

<p>
<b>The <tt>mintty</tt> Terminal Emulator Window</b><br>

<p>
The terminal window used in <i>MSYS2</i> is "<tt>mintty</tt>".  This
does NOT work directly with native Windows programs that work with a
console window, which includes the <i>XicTools</i> programs.  One must
run <i>WRspice</i> and possibly <i>Xic</i> with the "<tt>winpty</tt>"
program.  Just type <tt>winpty</tt> followed by the name and arguments
of the program you want to run.

<p>
For example, the command to run <i>WRspice</i> is
<blockquote><tt>
winpty wrspice ...
</tt></blockquote>
where the ...  represents the command line arguments to
<tt>wrspice</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>winpty</tt> program performs some magic that enables native
Windows programs expecting to find a <tt>cmd.com</tt> type of window
to work with the <tt>mintty</tt>.

<p>
<b><i>MSYS2</i> Basics</b><br>

<p>
The environment is a <tt>bash</tt> shell and environment very similar to
Linux.

<p>
You bring up a new shell window from the <b>MSYS2 64bit</b> / <b>MSYS2
MinGW x64</b> entry of the <b>Start</b> menu.  There are multiple
selections for <i>MSYS2</i> in the <b>Start</b> menu, including
<b>MSYS2 MinGW x86</b> which is the MINGW 32-bit subsystem, <b>MSYS2 MinGW
x64</b> is the MINGW 64-bit subsystem used for <i>XicTools</i>, and
<b>MSYS2 MSYS</b> is the <i>MSYS</i> subsystem without MinGW support. 
MinGW is "minimal Gnu (for) Windows" and is a library that provides a
limited Linux-like programming environment under Windows.  The
<i>XicTools</i> programs use this environment and are thus
Windows-native programs.

<p>
MSYS2 uses an underlying dll to provide a more complete Linux-like
environment, similar to <i>Cygwin</i>.  Installed programs are
available for all three subsystems, though the search order differs.
The <i>XicTools</i> do not use the dll, but the MSYS2 environment
is very convenient for use with the tools.
The <i>MSYS</i> subsystem provides the shell and other Linux-emulation
commands.  The <i>MinGW</i> subsystems provide libraries which enable
porting of Linux programs to native Windows.

<p>
From the shell window, the file system installed under <tt>c:\msys64</tt>
(or wherever the <tt>msys64</tt> directory is installed)
is taken as root.  One can access the files and directories explicitly
with a path starting with <tt>/c</tt> where the <tt>c</tt> can be any
 existing drive letter.
Your home directory is <tt>/home/yourname</tt>, or equivalently
<tt>/c/msys64/home/yourname</tt>.

<p>
It is important to realize that within MINGW and other native Windows
programs including <i>XicTools</i>, the paths used by the programs are
expected to be Windows paths, though they may use forward slashes.
For example, in the shell <tt>/usr/local</tt> is rooted to the <tt>msys64</tt>
directory, but within <i>Xic</i> <tt>/usr/local</tt> is rooted to the current
drive, e.g., <tt>c:/usr/local</tt>.
<p>
In <i>MSYS2</i>, the <tt>mount</tt> command can provide an alias between
the file system as viewed from the shell and that of Windows.  The command
<blockquote><tt>
mount c:/usr/local/xictools /usr/local/xictools
</tt></blockquote>
will map the Windows directory <tt>c:/usr/local/xictools</tt> to the
location <tt>/usr/local/xictools</tt> in the shell.  From a shell
window, <tt>/usr/local/xictools</tt> is equjivalent to
<tt>/c/usr/local/xictools</tt>, or in Windows
<tt>c:/usr/local/xictools</tt>, the default <i>Xictools</i>
installation location.

<p>
<b><i>XicTools</i> Installation procedure</b><br>

<p>
The easiest way to install/upgrade is to download and execute the
package files.  The programs being upgrated should not be running
during the update or the update will fail.  The files can also be saved
and executed at some later time.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<b>Conformity</b><br>

<p>
Most basic features are available under Windows.  Some of the more
advanced features are not.

<p>
<ul>
<li>There is no support for plug-ins, so presently no Tcl/Tk or
   Python script language support, and no OpenAccess connectivity.

<p>
<li>There is no provision for remote running of the programs as
   with the X window system in Linux.

<p>
<li>Windows does not provide a reliable interface for internet
   mail, so the email clients and crash-dump report in the
   <i>XicTools</i> may not work.  The mail in <i>XicTools</i>
   works by passing the message to a Windows interface called
   "MAPI", which in turn relies on another installed program to
   actually send the mail.

   <p>
   To get this working in Windows 8, I had to download and install
   something called "live mail" from Microsoft, which eventually
   worked.  This app supports MAPI, apparently the
   Windows 8 Mail app does not(?).  The Windows 8 app also does
   not work with POP3 servers.
</ul>

<h2>Removal</h2>

Programs are uninstalled with the <b>Settings</b> (gear-shaped icon) in
the <b>Start</b?  window, select <b>Apps</b> and scroll down to the
program to uninstall.  Click on the program icon and follow directions
to uninstall.

<h2>Updating</h2>

Once the <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i> have been installed, updating
could not be simpler.  See the program documentation:<br>
<ul>
<li>In <i>WRspice</i>, give the commands "<tt>help passwd</tt>" and
"<tt>help wrupdate</tt>".

<li>In <i>Xic</i>, with the mouse pointer in the main drawing window,
type "<tt>?!passwd</tt>" and "<tt>?!update"</tt>".
</ul>
These help topics explain how to set up and use the update features. 
The programs will check for updates when started, and updates can be
downloaded and installed.  Other programs will have a simplified
update checking/installing mechanism to be determined.  The programs
can also be updated manually by following the installation procedure.
