    Many devices reference models, which contain values for the
    numerous parameters describing the device, which would be
    cumbersome to include in each device reference.  Device models are
    specified on a <tt>.model</tt> line.  The model can be referenced
    by any number of devices of the corresponding type.

Many devices reference models, which contain values for the numerous
parameters describing the device, which would be cumbersome to include
in each device reference.  Device models are specified on a {\vt .model}
line.  The model can be referenced by any number of devices of the
corresponding type.

.model intercon ltra (r=0.2 l=9.13nh c=3.65pf len=5 rel=.002
 compactrel=1.0E-4)}

The {\vt .model} line specifies a set of model parameters that will be
used by one or more devices.  The {\it modname} is the model
name, which is case insensitive in matching references, and {\it
type} is one of the following types:
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Parameter values are defined by appending the parameter name, as given
for each model type, followed by an equal sign and the parameter
value.  Model parameters that are not given a value are generally
assigned default values.

The {\cb show} command with the {\vt -M} option is useful for
listing the parameters that can be specified to a model.  Only the
parameters not listed as ``{\vt RO}'' (read-only) can appear in a
{\vt .model} line.

In the tables that follow, the various model parameters are listed.
The ``units'' field of the tables provides the assumed units of measure
for the parameter, which is expressed using symbols from the following
table.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline

Default Models
!!HTML 
    Some simple devices support a "default model" in <i>WRspice</i>,
    meaning that if no model name is given in an instance line, an
    internally provided default model will be used.  Internally, all
    devices have a model structure, which is a container for the
    instances of that device type.  It is possible to access the
    default model used for various devices with <tt>.defmod</tt>
    lines.  This will affect all devices of the corresponding type
    that are not explicitly given a model in the instantiation line.

    <p>
    General form:
    <blockquote>
         <tt>.defmod</tt> <i>type</i> (<i>pname1=pval1</i>
             <i>pname2=pval2</i> ... )
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Examples:
    <blockquote><tt>
         .defmod r (m=1.2)<br>
         .defmod c (temp=300 tc1=.002)
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>type</i> is the name of the device model (the second name
    that would be provided on a <a href=".model"><tt>.model</tt></a>
    line) such as <tt>R</tt> (for resistors), <tt>C</tt> (for
    capacitors), and <tt>L</tt> (for inductors).

    <p>
    The type name is followed by a list of parameter assignments,
    optionally enclosed in parentheses.  These are precisely the same
    as would appear in a <tt>.model</tt> line for the device.  These
    provide the values for the parameters to be used in the default
    model.

    <p>
    Not all devices support default models, meaning that lack of a
    model name in an instance line is an error.  In particular devices
    that have a variable terminal count (optional nodes) require a
    model name and therefor don't support a default model.

    <p>
    It is probably also not possible to use a <tt>level</tt>
    parameter in a default model, and binning parameters will be
    ignored at best.  Anything too fancy should be done through a
    normal model, or there may be trouble.

    <p>
    The capability is very powerful, but might cause headaches, too,
    so the user should beware.  For example, if the following line is
    added to an existing deck
    <blockquote>
    <tt>.defmod R(M=1.2)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    all "standard" resistors in the deck will have their values
    reduced by about twenty percent.  This can be useful for corner
    analysis, but don't let the line get "lost" in a big file.

Analysis at Different Temperatures

    All input data for <i>WRspice</i> is assumed to have been measured
    at a nominal temperature of 25C, which can be changed by use of
    the <a href="tnom"><tt>tnom</tt></a> parameter on the <a

    27C.

    <p>
    This value can further be overridden for any device which models
    temperature effects by specifying the <tt>tnom</tt> parameter on
    the model itself.  The circuit simulation is performed at a
    temperature of 25C unless overridden by a <a

    control line.  Individual device instances may further override
    the circuit temperature through the specification of a

    <p>
    Temperature dependent support is provided for resistors and

    <p>
    Temperature appears explicitly in the exponential terms of the BJT
    and diode model equations.  In addition, saturation currents have
    a built-in temperature dependence.  The temperature dependence of
    the saturation current in the BJT models is determined by:

    <blockquote>
    <i>I</i><sub>s</sub>(<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) =

      <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>) /
     <i>k</i><i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>T</i><sub>0</sub> )
    </blockquote>

    where <i>k</i> is Boltzmann's constant, <i>q</i> is the electronic
    charge, <i>E</i><sub>g</sub> is the energy gap which is a model
    parameter, and <i>XTI</i> is the saturation current temperature
    exponent (also a model parameter, and usually equal to 3).

    <p>
    The temperature dependence of forward and reverse beta is according to
    the formula:

    <blockquote>
    <i<B</i>(<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) = <i<B</i>(<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>)  
     (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>)<sup><i>XTB</i></sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    where <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> are in Kelvin,
    and <i>XTB</i> is a user-supplied model parameter.  Temperature
    effects on beta are carried out by appropriate adjustment to the
    values of <i>B</i><sub>F</sub>, <i>I</i><sub>SE</sub>,
    <i>B</i><sub>R</sub>, and <i>I</i><sub>SC</sub> (<i>WRspice</i>

    Temperature dependence of the saturation current in the junction

     <i>Nk</i><i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>T</i><sub>0</sub> )
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    where <i>N</i> is the emission coefficient, which is a model
    parameter, and the other symbols have the same meaning as above. 
    Note that for Schottky barrier diodes, the value of the saturation
    current temperature exponent, <i>XTI</i>, is usually 2.

    <p>
    Temperature appears explicitly in the value of junction potential,
    <i>Phi</i> (in <i>WRspice</i>, <tt>phi</tt>), for all device
    models.  The temperature dependence is determined by:

    <blockquote>
    <i>Phi</i>(<i>T</i>) = (<i>kT</i>/<i>q</i>)
     ln( <i>N</i><sub>a</sub><i>N</i><sub>d</sub> /
     <i>N</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>T</i>)<sup>2</sup> )
    </blockquote>

    where <i>k</i> is Boltzmann's constant, <i>q</i> is the electronic
    charge, <i>N</i><sub>a</sub> is the acceptor impurity density,
    <i>N</i><sub>d</sub> is the donor impurity density, and
    <i>N</i><sub>i</sub> is the intrinsic carrier concentration.

    <p>
    Temperature appears explicitly in the value of surface mobility,
    <i>u</i><sub>0</sub> (or <tt>u0</tt>, for the MOSFET models). 
    This temperature dependence is determined by:

    <i>u</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>T</i>) =
     <i>u</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>) /  
     (<i>T</i>/<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>)<sup>1.5</sup>

    <p>
    The effects of temperature on resistors is modeled by the formula:

    where <i>T</i> is the circuit temperature, <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> is

All input data for {\WRspice} is assumed to have been measured at a
nominal temperature of 25C, which can be changed by use of the {\vt
tnom} parameter on the {\vt .options} control line.
Note that this is the same default temperature used in HSPICE, but is
not the same as in Berkeley SPICE3 or in {\WRspice} releases prior to
3.2.15, which was 27C.

This value can further be overridden for any device which models
temperature effects by specifying the {\vt tnom} parameter on the
model itself.  The circuit simulation is performed at a temperature of
25C unless overridden by a {\vt temp} parameter on the {\vt .options}
control line.  Individual device instances may further override the
circuit temperature through the specification of a {\vt temp}
parameter on the instance.

Temperature dependent support is provided for resistors and
semiconductor devices.  The details of the temperature adjustments can
be found in the description of the models.  For details of the BSIM3
temperature adjustment, see \cite{bsim3}.

Temperature appears explicitly in the exponential terms of the BJT and
diode model equations.  In addition, saturation currents have a
built-in temperature dependence.  The temperature dependence of the
saturation current in the BJT models is determined by:
\begin{displaymath}
I_s(T_1) = I_s(T_0)\left(\frac{T_1}{T_0}\right)^{XTI} exp\left(
\frac{E_gq(T_1 - T_0)}{kT_1T_0}\right)
\end{displaymath}
where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electronic charge, $E_g$ is
the energy gap which is a model parameter, and $XTI$ is the saturation
current temperature exponent (also a model parameter, and usually
equal to 3).

The temperature dependence of forward and reverse beta is according to
the formula:
\begin{displaymath}
\beta(T_1) = \beta(T_0)\left(\frac{T_1}{T_0}\right)^{XTB}
\end{displaymath}
where $T_1$ and $T_0$ are in Kelvin, and $XTB$ is a user-supplied model
parameter.  Temperature effects on beta are carried out by appropriate
adjustment to the values of $\beta_F$, $I_{SE}$, $\beta_R$, and
$I_{SC}$ ({\WRspice} model parameters {\vt bf, ise, br,} and {\vt isc,}
respectively.

Temperature dependence of the saturation current in the junction diode
model is determined by:
\begin{displaymath}
I_S(T_1) = I_S(T_0)\left(\frac{T_1}{T_0}\right)^{\frac{XTI}{N}}
exp\left(\frac{E_gq(T_1 - T_0)}{NkT_1T_0}\right)
\end{displaymath}
where $N$ is the emission coefficient, which is a model parameter, and
the other symbols have the same meaning as above.  Note that for
Schottky barrier diodes, the value of the saturation current
temperature exponent, $XTI$, is usually 2.

Temperature appears explicitly in the value of junction potential,
$\phi$ (in {\WRspice}, {\vt phi}), for all device models.  The
temperature dependence is determined by:
\begin{displaymath}
\phi(T) = \frac{kT}{q}ln\left(\frac{N_aN_d}{N_i(T)^2}\right)
\end{displaymath}
where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electronic charge, $N_a$ is
the acceptor impurity density, $N_d$ is the donor impurity density, and
$N_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.

Temperature appears explicitly in the value of surface mobility,
$\mu_0$ (or {\vt u0}, for the MOSFET models.  This temperature
dependence is determined by:
\begin{displaymath}
\mu_0(T) = \frac{\mu_0(T_0)}{\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{1.5}}
\end{displaymath}

The effects of temperature on resistors is modeled by the formula:
\begin{displaymath}
R(T) = R(T_0)[1 + TC_1(T-T_0) + TC_2(T-T_0)^2]
\end{displaymath}
where $T$ is the circuit temperature, $T_0$ is the nominal temperature,
and $TC_1$ and $TC_2$ are the first and second-order temperature coefficients.

The sheet resistance is used with the etch reduction parameters and {\it l}
and {\it w} from the resistor element line to determine the nominal
resistance by the formula
\begin{quote}
R = {\vt rsh}$\cdot$({\it l} - {\vt dl})/({\it w} - {\vt narrow}).
\end{quote}

The parameters {\vt defw} and {\vt defl} are used to supply default
values for element {\it w} and {\vt l} if not specified on the device
line.  A fatal error is produced if the resistance can't be determined
from given parameters.

After the nominal resistance is calculated, it is adjusted for
temperature by the formula:
\begin{quote}
R{\vt (temp)} = R{\vt (tnom)}$\cdot${\vt (1 $+$ tc1$\cdot$(temp$-$tnom) $+$

\end{quote}

Finally, the resistance is divided by the parallel multiplier ({\vt

The flicker noise capability can be used in noise analysis.  This
requires that {\vt kf}, {\vt l}, and {\vt w} be specified.  To use,
the instance line must reference a model, but also can have a
resistance specified which will override model calculation of

    <p>
    The use of an ideal element that is highly nonlinear such as a
    switch can cause large discontinuities to occur in the circuit
    node voltages.  A rapid change such as that associated with a
    switch changing state can cause numerical roundoff or tolerance
    problems leading to erroneous results or timestep difficulties. 
    The user of switches can improve the situation by taking the
    following steps.

    <p>
    First of all it is wise to set ideal switch impedances only high
    and low enough to be negligible with respect to other circuit
    elements.  Using switch impedances that are close to "ideal" in
    all cases will aggravate the problem of discontinuities mentioned
    above.  Of course, when modeling real devices such as MOSFETS, the
    on resistance should be adjusted to a realistic level depending on
    the size of the device being modeled.

    <p>
    If a wide range of on to off resistance must be used in the
    switches (<tt>roff/ron</tt> > 1e+12), then the tolerance on errors
    allowed during transient analysis should be decreased by using the
    <tt>.options</tt> line and specifying <tt>trtol</tt> to be less
    than the default value of 7.0 (options can also be set from the
    prompt line from within <i>WRspice</i>).  When switches are placed
    around capacitors, then the option <tt>chgtol</tt> should also be
    reduced.  Suggested values for these two options are 1.0 and 1e-16
    respectively.  These changes inform <i>WRspice</i> to be more
    careful around the switch points so that no errors are made due to
    the rapid change in the circuit.

The general transmission line model may be used in conjunction with
transmission line devices, though the use is optional.  The parameters
that appear in the model are the same parameters that can be given on
the device line (with the exception of the initial conditions).  These
parameters are discussed in section \ref{tline} describing the
general transmission line. 

Transmission line models can have either of two type names:  {\vt tra}
or {\vt ltra}.  The {\vt ltra} name is required to support the SPICE3
LTRA lossy transmission line model.  If this name is used, the {\vt
level} will default to 2.  This will be overridden if the level is set
explicitly.  If the {\vt tra} keyword is used, then the level will
default to 1.  Otherwise, the two words are interchangeable.

The parameters provided in the model will serve as defaults to the
referencing device, but can be overridden if explicitly set on the
device line.

Uniform RC Line Model

    <b>Type Name:</b> <tt>urc</tt>

    <p>
    The <a href="urc">urc</a> model is derived from a model proposed
    by L.  Gertzberrg in 1974.  The model is accomplished by a
    subcircuit type expansion of the URC line into a network of lumped
    RC segments with internally generated nodes.  The RC segments are
    in a geometric progression, increasing toward the middle of the
    URC line, with <tt>k</tt> as a proportionality constant.  The
    number of lumped segments used, if not specified on the urc line,
    is determined by the following formula:

    <blockquote>
    N = log(2pi&#183;<i>Fmax</i>&#183;<i>RC</i>&#183;
     ((<tt>k</tt>-1)/<tt>k</tt>)<sup>2</sup>) / log(<tt>k</tt>)
    </blockquote>

    where <i>Fmax</i> is the maximum frequency, and <i>R</i> and
    <i>C</i> are the total values for the given length.

    <p>
    The urc line will be made up strictly of resistor and capacitor
    segments unless the <tt>isperl</tt> parameter is given a non-zero
    value, in which case the capacitors are replaced with reverse
    biased diodes with a zero-bias junction capacitance equivalent to
    the capacitance replaced, and with a saturation current taking the

The urc model is derived from a model proposed by L.  Gertzberrg in
1974.  The model is generated by a subcircuit type expansion of the
urc line into a network of lumped RC segments with internally
generated nodes.  The RC segments are in a geometric progression,
increasing toward the middle of the urc line, with {\vt k} as a
proportionality constant.  The number of lumped segments used, if not
specified on the urc line, is determined by the following formula:

\begin{displaymath}
N = \frac{log\left(2{\pi}Fmax RC \left((k-1)/k\right)^2\right)}{log(k)}
\end{displaymath}

where {\it Fmax} is the maximum frequency, and {\it R} and {\it C} are
the total values for the given length.

The urc will be made up strictly of resistor and capacitor segments
unless the {\vt isperl} parameter is given a non-zero value, in which
case the capacitors are replaced with reverse biased diodes with a
zero-bias junction capacitance equivalent to the capacitance replaced,
and with a saturation current taking the value given {\vt isperl\/} in
amps per meter of transmission line, and with an optional series

    The <a href="bjt">bipolar junction transistor</a> model in

    model of Gummel and Poon.  This modified Gummel-Poon model extends
    the original model to include several effects at high bias levels.

    better both physical and circuit design thinking.

{\cb Type Names:} {\vt npn}, {\vt pnp}

The bipolar junction transistor model in {\WRspice} is an adaptation of
the integral charge control model of Gummel and Poon.  This modified
Gummel-Poon model extends the original model to include several
effects at high bias levels.  The model will automatically simplify to
the simpler Ebers-Moll model when certain parameters are not
specified.  The parameter names used in the modified Gummel-Poon model
have been chosen to be more easily understood by the program user, and
to reflect better both physical and circuit design thinking.

The dc model is defined by the parameters {\vt is}, {\vt bf}, {\vt
nf}, {\vt ise}, {\vt ikf}, and {\vt ne} which determine the forward
current gain characteristics, {\vt is}, {\vt br}, {\vt nr}, {\vt isc},
{\vt ikr}, and {\vt nc} which determine the reverse current gain
characteristics, and {\vt vaf} and {\vt var} which determine the
output conductance for forward and reverse regions.  Three ohmic
resistances {\vt rb}, {\vt rc}, and {\vt re} are included, where {\vt
rb} can be high current dependent.  Base charge storage is modeled by
forward and reverse transit times, {\vt tf} and {\vt tr}, the forward
transit time {\vt tf} being bias dependent if desired, and nonlinear
depletion layer capacitances which are determined by {\vt cje}, {\vt
vje}, and {\vt mje} for the B-E junction, {\vt cjc}, {\vt vjc}, and
{\vt mjc} for the B-C junction, and {\vt cjs}, {\vt vjs}, and {\vt
mjs} for the C-S (Collector-Substrate) junction.  The temperature
dependence of the saturation current, {\vt is}, is determined by the
energy gap, {\vt eg}, and the saturation current temperature exponent,
{\vt xti}.  Additionally base current temperature dependence is
modeled by the beta temperature exponent {\vt xtb} in the new model.
The values specified are assumed to have been measured at the
temperature {\vt tnom}, which can be specified on the {\vt .options}
line or overridden by a specification on the {\vt .model} line.

The BJT parameters used in the modified Gummel-Poon model are listed
below.  The parameter names used in earlier versions of SPICE2 are
still accepted.  The parameters marked with an asterisk in the {\bf
area} column scale with the {\vt area} parameter given in the device
line.

There is also a level=4 BJT model which uses the VBIC equation set, as
used in the NGspice-17 simulator.  This model is documented elsewhere.

capacitances for both gate junctions which vary as the -1/2 power of
junction voltage and are defined by the parameters {\vt cgs}, {\vt

The MESFET model is derived from the GaAs FET model of Statz et al. as
described in\cite{statz}.  The dc characteristics are defined by the
parameters {\vt vto}, {\vt b}, and {\vt beta}, which determine the
variation of drain current with gate voltage, {\vt alpha}, which
determines saturation voltage, and {\vt lambda}, which determines the
output conductance.  The formula are given by
\begin{displaymath}
Id = \frac{\beta(V_{gs}-V_T)^2}{1+b(V_{gs}-V_T)}\left(1-\left(1-\alpha
\frac{V_{ds}}{3}\right)^3\right)(1+\lambda V_{ds})\quad\mbox{for}\quad
 0 < V_{ds} < 3/\alpha
\end{displaymath}
\begin{displaymath}
Id = \frac{\beta(V_{gs}-V_T)^2}{1+b(V_{gs}-V_T)}(1+\lambda V_{ds})\quad
\mbox{for}\quad V_{ds} > 3/\alpha
\end{displaymath}

Two ohmic resistances, {\vt rd} and {\vt rs}, are included.  Charge
storage is modeled by total gate charge as a function of gate-drain
and gate-source voltages and is defined by the parameters {\vt cgs},
{\vt cgd}, and {\vt pb}.

MOSFET Device Models

    The device library supplied with <i>WRspice</i> contains a number
    of MOS models supplied by various development groups.  The models
    that are currently provided in the device library are listed
    below.  Specific models are selected through the
    <tt>level</tt> parameter.  Other parameters are specific to that
    model, and there is not in general a great deal of commonality of
    parameter names between the various models.  Only the simple
    models provided in SPICE3 will be documented.  Documentation for
    the third-party models is available from the Whiteley Research
    <a href="http://wrcad.com/restricted/xictools/docs/">web
    site</a>.

    <p>
    The <a href="devmod"><b>devmod</b></a> command can be used to
    change the model levels of these devices, with the exception of
    the MOS device (levels 1-3 and 6) whose level numbers are fixed. 
    Alternatively, the <a href=".mosmap"><tt>.mosmap</tt></a> keyword
    can be used in SPICE input to map the level number of a foreign
    simulator into the number expected by <i>WRspice</i>.  The
    <tt>.mosmap</tt> line, which must be read before the corresponding
    <tt>.model</tt> line, is followed by two integers.  The first
    integer is the level number found in the file, the second is the
    <i>WRspice</i> level number appropriate for the model parameter
    set.  Both of these methods avoid the need to copy the model file
    and edit the level number.

    <h2>HSPICE MOS Level 49 Compatibility in <i>WRspice</i></h2>

    In <i>WRspice</i>, level 49 is equivalent to level 7, which is the
    BSIM3v3.2 model from Berkeley.  However, there are differences in
    the parameter sets between this model and the level 49 model of <a
    href="hspicesim">HSPICE</a>, which is based on BSIM3 and
    customized for HSPICE.  In particular, the HSPICE extensions are
    not supported in <i>WRspice</i>.

    <p>
    This document lists the parameters that are accepted in HSPICE level
    49 model parameter sets that are not supported in the Berkeley model,
    or have different interpretation.  The parameters are listed in
    alphabetical order, by category.  This list is possibly incomplete.

    <p>
    This list also applies to the level 8 (BSIM3v3.2.4) model in
    <i>WRspice</i>.  In <i>WRspice</i> release 2.2.50 and earlier,
    level 49 was mapped to level 8.  However, the <tt>VERSION</tt>
    parameter in level 8 <i>must</i> be "3.2.4" if given, which is not
    generally true in imported files.  The level 7 model handles
    earlier versions, notably 3.1, without complaint.

    <h3>1. General parameters</h3>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>BINFLAG</tt><dd>This is not used for <i>WRspice</i>.
    <dt><tt>SCALM, SCALE</tt><dd>In HSPICE these are the "model scaling factor"

      to BSIM3, and serves as the default for devices that use the model.  If
      also given on the device line, that value will override.

    <h3>2. Length and Width</h3>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LREF, WREF</tt><dd>In HSPICE these are "channel length reference"

      (levels 7, 8, 9, 47, 49, and 53) implementing the formula below.
      With earlier releases, one must modify <tt>WINT</tt> and <tt>LINT</tt>.

these devices, with the exception of the MOS device (levels 1--3 and
6) whose level numbers are fixed.  Alternatively, the {\vt .mosmap}
keyword can be used in SPICE input to map the level number of a
foreign simulator into the number expected by {\WRspice}.  The {\vt
.mosmap} line, which must be read before the corresponding {\vt
.model} line, is followed by two integers.  The first integer is the
level number found in the file, the second is the {\WRspice} level
number appropriate for the model parameter set.  Both of these methods
avoid the need to copy the model file and edit the level number. 

The table below lists all of the MOS levels recognized in {\WRspice}.

\subsubsection{HSPICE MOS Level 49 Compatibility in {\WRspice}}

In {\WRspice}, level 49 is equivalent to level 7, which is the
BSIM3v3.2 model from Berkeley.  However, there are differences in the
parameter sets between this model and the level 49 model of HSPICE,
which is based on BSIM3 and customized for HSPICE.  In particular, the
HSPICE extensions are not supported in {\WRspice}.

This document lists the parameters that are accepted in HSPICE level
49 model parameter sets that are not supported in the Berkeley model,
or have different interpretation.  The parameters are listed in
alphabetical order, by category.  This list is possibly incomplete.

This list also applies to the level 8 (BSIM3v3.2.4) model in
{\WRspice}.  In {\WRspice} release 2.2.50 and earlier, level 49 was
mapped to level 8.  However, the {\vt VERSION} parameter in level 8
{\it must} be ``3.2.4'' if given, which is not generally true in
imported files.  The level 7 model handles earlier versions, notably
3.1, without complaint.

\paragraph{General parameters}

\begin{description}
\item{\vt BINFLAG}\\
 This is not used for {\WRspice}.
\item{{\vt SCALM}, {\vt SCALE}}\\
 In HSPICE these are the ``model scaling factor'' and ``element scaling
 factor''.  There are no {\WRspice} equivalents.
\item{\vt TREF}\\
 Temperature at which parameters are extracted.  This is taken as an
 alias for the BSIM3 {\vt TNOM} parameter in {\WRspice}.
\item{\vt NQSMOD}\\
 This is accepted by {\WRspice} as an extension to BSIM3, and serves as
 the default for devices that use the model.  If also given on the
 device line, that value will override.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Length and Width}

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt LREF}, {\vt WREF}}\\
 In HSPICE these are ``channel length reference'' and ``channel width
 reference''.  There are no {\WRspice} equivalents.
\item{{\vt XW}, {\vt XL}}\\
 In HSPICE these account for masking and etching effects.  In release
 3.1.5 and later, the {\vt XW} and {\vt XL} parameters are handled by
 the BSIM3 bulk-mos models (levels 7, 8, 9, 47, 49, and 53)
 implementing the formula below.  With earlier releases, one must
 modify {\vt WINT} and {\vt LINT}.
\begin{quote}
  $WINT_{new}$ = $WINT_{old}$ - $XW$/2\\
  $LINT_{new}$ = $LINT_{old}$ - $XL$/2
\end{quote}
\end{description}

\paragraph{MOS Diode Model Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item{\vt ACM}\\
 In HSPICE this selects the area calculation method.  {\WRspice} uses
 only one model for the bulk-to-source and bulk-to-drain diodes.  It
 corresponds to the HSPICE equivalent of {\vt ACM}=0.  Do not use this
 parameter for {\WRspice}.  {\vt ACM} is not needed if {\vt AS}, {\vt
 AD}, {\vt PS}, and {\vt PD} are specified explicitly.
\item{\vt CJGATE}\\
 In HSPICE this is the zero-bias gate-edge sidewall bulk junction
 capacitance used with {\vt ACM}=3 only.  There is no {\WRspice}
 equivalent.
\item{{\vt HDIF}, {\vt LDIF}}\\
 In HSPICE this is the ``length of heavily doped diffusion'' and
 ``length of lightly doped diffusion''.  They are used with the HSPICE
 {\vt ACM}=2 MOS diode models, and there are no {\WRspice} equivalents. 
 {\vt HDIF} and {\vt LDIF} are not needed if {\vt AS}, {\vt AD}, {\vt
 PS}, and {\vt PD} are specified explicitly.
\item{\vt N}\\
 In HSPICE this is the ``emission coefficient'', and is taken as an
 alias for the BSIM3 {\vt NJ} parameter.
\item{\vt RDC}\\
 In HSPICE this is additional drain resistance due to contact
 resistance.  If {\vt RD} is specified, use
\begin{quote}
 $RD_{new}$ = $RD_{old}$ + $RDC$
\end{quote}
 If {\vt RSH} is specified, then {\vt RDC} should be added to {\vt
 RD}={\vt NRD}*{\vt RSH}.  Since {\vt NRD} is a device parameter and
 not a model parameter, a typical {\vt NRD} value must be used.
\item{\vt RSC}\\
 In HSPICE this is additional source resistance due to contact
 resistance.  If {\vt RS} is specified, use
\begin{quote}
 $RS_{new}$ = $RS_{old}$ + $RSC$
\end{quote}
 If {\vt RSH} is specified, then {\vt RSC} should be added to {\vt
 RS}={\vt NRS}*{\vt RSH}.  Since {\vt NRS} is a device parameter and
 not a model parameter, a typical {\vt NRS} value must be used.
\item{{\vt WMLT}, {\vt LMLT}}\\
 In HSPICE these are ``length of heavily doped diffusion'' and ``length
 of lightly doped diffusion'' used in the {\vt ACM}=1--3 models.  There
 are no {\WRspice} equivalents.  {\vt WMLT} and {\vt LMLT} are not
 needed if {\vt AS}, {\vt AD} {\vt PS}, and {\vt PD} are specified
 explicitly.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Capacitance Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item{\vt CAPOP}\\
 Do not use {\vt CAPOP} for {\WRspice}.  {\vt CAPMOD} is included in
 the BSIM3 model.  {\vt CAPOP} is HSPICE specific, and not included in
 the BSIM3 parameter set.  The default BSIM3 capacitance model is {\vt
 CAPMOD=3}.
\item{\vt CJM}\\
 This is taken as an alias for the BSIM3 {\vt CJ} parameter in
 {\WRspice}.
\item{\vt MJ0}\\
 This is taken as an alias for the BSIM3 {\vt MJ} parameter in
 {\WRspice}.
\item{\vt PJ}\\
 This is taken as an alias for the BSIM3 {\vt PB} parameter in
 {\WRspice}.
\item{{\vt CTA}, {\vt CTP}}\\
 In HSPICE these are the ``junction capacitance CJ temp.  coeff.'' and
 ``junction sidewall capacitance CJSW temp.  coeff'', used with {\vt
 TLEVC=1}.  There are no {\WRspice} equivalents.
\item{{\vt PTA}, {\vt PTP}}\\
 In HSPICE these are the ``junction potential PB temp.  coeff.'' and
 ``fermi potential PHI temp.  coeff'', used with {\vt TLEVC=}1 or 2. 
 There are no {\WRspice} equivalents.
\item{\vt PHP}\\
 This is taken as an alias for the BSIM3 {\vt PBSW} parameter in
 {\WRspice}
\item{{\vt TLEV}, {\vt TLEVC}}\\
 In HSPICE this is the ``temperature equation level selector'' and
 ``temperature equation level selector for junction capacitances and
 potentials''.  Do not use these parameters for {\WRspice}.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Impact Ionization}

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt ALPHA}, {\vt LALPHA}, {\vt WALPHA}, {\vt VCR}, {\vt LVCR},
 {\vt WVCR}, and {\vt IIRAT}}\\
 These are impact ionization parameters in HSPICE.  There are no
 {\WRspice} equivalents.  BSIM3 has its own impact ionization model
 which is instead used in most cases.
\end{description}

\paragraph{V3.2 parameters}

Level 49 parameter sets in {\WRspice} may include BSIM3v3.2
parameters, though historically HSPICE level 49 was based on
BSIM3v3.1.  The following parameters are new for v3.2:

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt ALPHA1}, {\vt ACDE}, {\vt MOIN}, {\vt NOFF}, {\vt VOFFCV}}\\
 All except {\vt ALPHA1} are used in a new capacitance model ({\vt
 CAPMOD=3}).  {\vt ALPHA1} modifies the substrate current equation as
 follows:
\begin{quote}
 {\vt Isub \symbol{126} (ALPHA0 + ALPHA1*Leff) / Leff}
\end{quote}
\end{description}

    <b>Type Names:</b> <tt>nmos</tt>, <tt>pmos</tt>

    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> provides the basic MOS models provided in SPICE2/3,
    plus third-party models from various development groups.  A
    complete listing of the MOS models supported in the current
    <i>WRspice</i> release is provided <a href="moslevel">here</a>. 
    Documentation for the third-party models is available on the
    Whiteley Research <a
    href="http://wrcad.com/restricted/xictools/docs/"> web
    site</a>.  This section will describe the features common to all
    MOS models.

    <p>
    The <tt>level</tt> parameter in the MOS model description
    specifies the model to be used.  Where possible, the level chosen
    for the imported models will match the level used in Synopsys
    <a href="hspicesim">HSPICE</a>.

    <h3>MOS Default Values</h3>

    <p>
    The MOS device length, width, source area and drain area will
    default to common values if not specified for a device.  These
    values are set by the following variables:

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Variable</th> <th>Purpose</th> <th>Default</th></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="defad"><tt>defad</tt></a></td> <td>drain area</td>
      <td>0 M<sup>2</sup></td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="defas"><tt>defas</tt></a></td> <td>source area</td>
      <td>0 M<sup>2</sup></td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="defl"><tt>defl</tt></a></td>
      <td>gate length</td> <td>1 uM</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="defw"><tt>defw</tt></a></td>
      <td>gate width</td> <td>1 uM</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>MOS Model Binning</h3>

    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> supports MOS model selection by the L and W
    parameters from the MOS <a href="mos">element line</a>.  This
    facility is used to automatically select the proper model for a
    specific device dimension, from among several models which are
    nominally similar but optimized for a particular device size. 
    This facility works with any of the MOS model levels.

    <p>
    The MOS models for the specified ranges should use the same "base"
    name plus an arbitrary but unique extension separated from the
    base name with a period.  The element line should refer to the
    model by the base name.  Each of the different models with the
    same base name should have ranges specified with the model
    parameters <tt>LMIN</tt>, <tt>LMAX</tt>, <tt>WMIN</tt>,
    <tt>WMAX</tt>.  The model associated with an instance is the first
    model found such that the base name matches, and <tt>LMIN &#60= L
    &#60= LMAX</tt> and <tt>WMIN &#60= W &#60= WMAX</tt>.  If the
    MIN/MAX parameters are not found in a model line, the test is
    always true, i.e., if no MIN/MAX parameters are specified in a
    model, that model would match any <tt>L</tt>, <tt>W</tt>.

    <p>
    Example:

    <blockquote><tt>
    m1 1 2 3 4 nm l=1.5u w=1u<br>
    m2 a b c d nm l=3u w=5u<br>
    ...<br>
    .model nm.1 nmos(level=8 lmin=1u lmax=2u wmin=1u wmax=2u ...)<br>
    .model nm.2 nmos(level=8 lmin=2u lmax=4u wmin=1u wmax=2u ...)<br>
    .model nm.3 nmos(level=8 lmin=1u lmax=2u wmin=2u wmax=5u ...)<br>
    .model nm.4 nmos(level=8 lmin=2u lmax=4u wmin=2u wmax=5u ...)<br>
    .model nm.5 nmos(level=8 ...)
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    In this example <tt>m1</tt> would use model <tt>nm.1</tt>,
    <tt>m2</tt> would use <tt>nm.4</tt>.  The model <tt>nm.5</tt> is a
    "catch all" for elements that don't match the other models.  The
    extension can be omitted in one of the model names.

    <p>
    If a model that uses selection cannot be resolved, the circuit
    run will be aborted.

    <h3>SPICE2/3 Legacy MOS Models</h3>

    This section describes the basic SPICE2/3 models.  The level 1-3
    and 6 models can be used for quick analysis and examples, but are
    probably not suitable for serious design work using modern
    deep-submicron devices.

    <p>
    The dc characteristics of the level 1 through level 3 MOSFETs are
    defined by the device parameters <tt>vto</tt>, <tt>kp</tt>,
    <tt>lambda</tt>, <tt>phi</tt> and <tt>gamma</tt>.  These
    parameters are computed by <i>WRspice</i> if process parameters
    (<tt>nsub</tt>, <tt>tox</tt>, ...) are given, but user-specified
    values always override.  <tt>vto</tt> is positive (negative) for
    enhancement mode and negative (positive) for depletion mode
    N-channel (P-channel) devices.  Charge storage is modeled by three
    constant capacitors, <tt>cgso</tt>, <tt>cgdo</tt>, and
    <tt>cgbo</tt> which represent overlap capacitances, by the
    nonlinear thin-oxide capacitance which is distributed among the
    gate, source, drain, and bulk regions, and by the nonlinear
    depletion-layer capacitances for both substrate junctions divided
    into bottom and periphery, which vary as the <tt>mj</tt> and
    <tt>mjsw</tt> power of junction voltage respectively, and are
    determined by the parameters <tt>cbd</tt>, <tt>cbs</tt>,
    <tt>cj</tt>, <tt>cjsw</tt>, <tt>mj</tt>, <tt>mjsw</tt> and
    <tt>pb</tt>.  Charge storage effects are modeled by the piecewise
    linear voltage-dependent capacitance model proposed by Meyer.  The
    thin-oxide charge storage effects are treated slightly different
    for the level 1 model.  These voltage-dependent capacitances are
    included only if <tt>tox</tt> is specified in the input
    description and they are represented using Meyer's formulation.

    <p>
    There is some overlap among the parameters describing the
    junctions, e.g.  the reverse current can be input either as
    <tt>is</tt> (in A) or as <tt>js</tt> (in A/M<sup>2</sup>). 
    Whereas the first is an absolute value the second is multiplied by
    <tt>ad</tt> and <tt>as</tt> to give the reverse current of the
    drain and source junctions respectively.  This methodology has
    been chosen since there is no sense in relating always junction
    characteristics with <tt>ad</tt> and <tt>as</tt> entered on the
    device line; the areas can be defaulted.  The same idea applies
    also to the zero-bias junction capacitances <tt>cbd</tt> and
    <tt>cbs</tt> (in F) on one hand, and <tt>cj</tt> (in
    F/M<sup>2</sup>) on the other.  The parasitic drain and source
    series resistance can be expressed as either <tt>rd</tt> and
    <tt>rs</tt> (in ohms) or <tt>rsh</tt> (in ohms/sq.), the latter
    being multiplied by the number of squares <tt>nrd</tt> and
    <tt>nrs</tt> input on the device line.

!!LATEX mosmodel elements.tex
{\cb Type Names:} {\vt nmos}, {\vt pmos}

{\WRspice} provides the basic MOS models provided in SPICE2/3, plus
third-party models from various development groups.  A complete
listing of the MOS models supported in the current {\WRspice} release
is provided below.  Documentation for the third-party models is
available on the Whiteley Research web site.  This section will
describe the features common to all MOS models.

The {\vt level} parameter in the MOS model description specifies the
model to be used.  Where possible, the level chosen for the imported
models will match the level used in Synopsys HSPICE.

\subsubsection{MOS Default Values}
\index{MOSFET defaults}

The MOS device length, width, source area and drain area will default
to common values if not specified for a device.  These values are set
by the following variables:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
\bf Variable & \bf Purpose & \bf Default\\ \hline\hline
\et defad & drain area & 0 $M^2$\\ \hline
\et defas & source area & 0 $M^2$\\ \hline
\et defl & gate length & 1 $uM$\\ \hline
\et defw & gate width & 1 $uM$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{MOS Model Binning}
\index{MOSFET binning}

{\WRspice} supports MOS model selection by the {\vt L} and {\vt W} MOS
element line.  This facility is used to automatically select the
proper model for a specific device dimension, from among several
models which are nominally similar but optimized for a particular
device size.  This facility works with any of the MOS model levels.

\index{MOSFET L/W selection}
The MOS models for the specified ranges should use the same ``base''
name plus an arbitrary but unique extension separated from the base
name with a period.  The element line should refer to the model by the
base name.  Each of the different models with the same base name
should have ranges specified with the model parameters {\vt LMIN},
{\vt LMAX}, {\vt WMIN}, {\vt WMAX}.  The model associated with an
instance is the first model found such that the base name matches, and
{\vt LMIN <= L <= LMAX} and {\vt WMIN <= W <= WMAX}.  If the MIN/MAX
parameters are not found in a model line, the test is always true,
i.e., if no MIN/MAX parameters are specified in a model, that model
would match any {\vt L}, {\vt W}.

Example:
\begin{quote}\vt
    m1 1 2 3 4 nm l=1.5u w=1u\\
    m2 a b c d nm l=3u w=5u\\
    ...\\
    .model nm.1 nmos(level=8 lmin=1u lmax=2u wmin=1u wmax=2u ...)\\
    .model nm.2 nmos(level=8 lmin=2u lmax=4u wmin=1u wmax=2u ...)\\
    .model nm.3 nmos(level=8 lmin=1u lmax=2u wmin=2u wmax=5u ...)\\
    .model nm.4 nmos(level=8 lmin=2u lmax=4u wmin=2u wmax=5u ...)\\
    .model nm.5 nmos(level=8 ...)\\
\end{quote}

In this example {\vt m1} would use model {\vt nm.1}, and {\vt m2}
would use {\vt nm.4}.  The model {\vt nm.5} is a ``catch all'' for
elements that don't match the other models.  The extension can be
omitted in one of the model names.

If a model that uses selection cannot be resolved, the circuit run
will be aborted.

\subsubsection{SPICE2/3 Legacy Models}

This section describes the basic SPICE2/3 models.  The level 1--3 and
6 models can be used for quick analysis and examples, but are probably
not suitable for serious design work using modern deep-submicron
devices.

The dc characteristics of the level 1 through level 3 MOSFETs are
defined by the device parameters {\vt vto}, {\vt kp}, {\vt lambda},
{\vt phi} and {\vt gamma}.  These parameters are computed by
{\WRspice} if process parameters ({\vt nsub}, {\vt tox}, ...) are
given, but user-specified values always override.  The parameter {\vt
vto} is positive (negative) for enhancement mode and negative
(positive) for depletion mode N-channel (P-channel) devices.  Charge
storage is modeled by three constant capacitors, {\vt cgso}, {\vt
cgdo}, and {\vt cgbo} which represent overlap capacitances, by the
nonlinear thin-oxide capacitance which is distributed among the gate,
source, drain, and bulk regions, and by the nonlinear depletion-layer
capacitances for both substrate junctions divided into bottom and
periphery, which vary as the {\vt mj} and {\vt mjsw} power of junction
voltage respectively, and are determined by the parameters {\vt cbd},
{\vt cbs}, {\vt cj}, {\vt cjsw}, {\vt mj}, {\vt mjsw} and {\vt pb}. 
Charge storage effects are modeled by the piecewise linear voltage
dependent capacitance model proposed by Meyer.  The thin-oxide charge
storage effects are treated slightly differently for the level 1
model.  These voltage-dependent capacitances are included only if {\vt
tox} is specified in the input description and they are represented
using Meyer's formulation.

There is some overlap among the parameters describing the junctions,
e.g., the reverse current can be input either as {\vt is} (in Amps) or
as {\vt js} (in Amps/m$^2$).  Whereas the first is an absolute value,
the second is multiplied by {\vt ad} and {\vt as} to give the reverse
current of the drain and source junctions respectively.  This
methodology has been chosen to avoid always relating junction
characteristics with {\vt ad} and {\vt as} entered on the device line;
the areas can be defaulted.  The same idea applies also to the
zero-bias junction capacitances {\vt cbd} and {\vt cbs} (in Farads) on
one hand, and {\vt cj} (in F/m$^2$) on the other.  The parasitic drain
and source series resistance can be expressed as either {\vt rd} and
{\vt rs} (in ohms) or {\vt rsh} (in ohms/sq.), the latter being
multiplied by the number of squares {\vt nrd} and {\vt nrs} input on
the device line.

Josephson Models
!!HTML
    <b>Type Name:</b> <tt>jj</tt>

    <p>
    The default <a href="jj">Josephson junction</a> model is an
    extended version of the RSJ model as used by <a
    href="jewett">Jewett</a>.  There are actually three Josephson
    junction models available, through the <tt>level</tt> model
    parameter, which can take values 1 through 3.  The default
    <tt>level=1</tt> model is the RSJ model mentioned.  This model has
    a simplified Verilog-A version which can be found among the
    Verilog-A examples.  This can be compiled with the <b>adms</b>
    utility into a run-time loadable module which can be loaded with
    the <a href="devload"><b>devload</b></a> command.  A pre-compiled
    module is provided with the example.  Once loaded into
    <i>WRspice</i>, the model can be accessed with <tt>level=2</tt>.

    <p>
    For <tt>level=3</tt>, a <a href="tjmodel">microscopic tunnel
    junction</a> "Werthamer" model, also known as a tunnel junction
    model (TJM) is provided.  The model is more physics-based than the
    empirical RSJ model.

    <p>
    The parameters marked with an asterisk in the <b>area</b> column
    scale with the <tt>ics</tt> parameter given in the device line,
    not necessarily linearly.  The present model paradigm assumes that
    the model parameters apply to a "reference" junction, which is a
    typical mid-critical current device as produced by the fouhdry. 
    Instantiations derive from the reference device for a desired
    critical current.  Appropriate scaling, not necessarily linear,
    will be applied when formulating instance capacitance and
    conductances.

    <p>
    Detailed information about these parameters is presented below. 
    Unless stated otherwise, this information applies to both the
    internal RSJ (<tt>level=1</tt>) and the Verilog-A Josephson
    junction model provided with <i>WRspice</i> in the Verilog-A
    examples (<tt>level=2</tt>).

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>level</tt><dd>
    This specifies the model to use.  There are three choices provided
    in <i>WRspice</i>.  Level 1 (the default) is the internal RSJ
    model, and level 2 indicates the Verilog-A example RSJ model,
    which is available if it has been loaded.  The third choice is
    level 3, which is an internal microscopic <a
    hrref="tjmodel">tunnel junction model</a>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>pijj</tt><dd>
    If this flag is given a nonzero integer value, the junctions will
    be modeled as a "pi junction" meaning that the zero-current phase
    is &pi; rather than zero.  Such devices have been fabricated using
    ferromagnetic barrier materials.  Although these devices have some
    interesting behavior, they are not at this point available or used
    with any frequency.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>rtype</tt><dd>
    The <tt>rtype</tt> parameter determines the quasiparticle branch
    modeling employed.  Legal values are listed below, only 0 and 1
    are supported in level 2.
    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>0</td><td>  The junction is completely unshunted, all shunt
        conductance set to zero.
    <tr><td>1</td><td>  Standard model (the default)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>  Analytic exponentially-derived approximation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>  Fifth order polynomial approximation model</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>  "Temperature" variation, allow modulation of the gap
        parameter</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Values for <tt>rtype</tt> larger than 1 are not currently
    supported in the Verilog-A model supplied in <i>WRspice</i> with
    the Verilog-A examples.

    <p>
    The default is <tt>rtype</tt>=1.  Setting <tt>rtype</tt>=0 will
    disable modeling of the quasiparticle current, effectively setting
    the shunt resistance to infinity.  Conditions with
    <tt>rtype</tt>=1 and <tt>rtype</tt>=2 are as described by Jewett,
    however it is not assumed that the normal resistance projects
    through the origin.  The <tt>icfact</tt> parameter can be set to a
    value lower than the default BCS theoretical value to reflect the
    behavior of most real junctions.  The quasiparticle resistance is
    approximated with a fifth order polynomial if <tt>rtype</tt>=3,
    which seems to give good results for the modeling of some NbN
    junctions (which tend to have gently sloping quasiparticle
    curves).

    <p>
    <tt>Rtype</tt>=4 uses a piecewise-linear quasiparticle
    characteristic identical to <tt>rtype</tt>=1, however the gap
    voltage and critical current are now proportional to the absolute
    value of the control current set with a
    <tt>control=</tt><i>src_name</i> entry in the device line.  This
    is to facilitate modeling of temperature changes or nonequilibrium
    effects.  For control current of 1 (Amp) or greater, the full gap
    and critical current are used, otherwise they decrease linearly to
    zero.  If no device control source is specified, the algorithm
    reverts to <tt>rtype</tt>=1.  It is expected that a nonlinear
    transfer function will be implemented with a controlled source,
    which will in turn provide the controlling current to the junction
    in this mode.  For example, the controlling current can be
    translated from a circuit voltage representing temperature with an
    external nonlinear source.  The functional dependence is in
    general a complicated function, but a reasonable approximation is
    1 - (T/T<sub>c</sub>)<sup>4</sup>.  See the examples for an
    example input file (<a href="ex10"><tt>ex10.cir</tt></a>) which
    illustrates <tt>rtype</tt>=4.

    <p>
    It is currently not possible to use other than the piecewise
    linear model with this type of temperature variation.  If
    <tt>rtype</tt>=4, then legal values for the critical current
    parameter are <tt>cct</tt>=0 (no critical current) and
    <tt>cct</tt>=1 (fixed critical current).  If another value is
    specified for <tt>cct</tt>, <tt>cct</tt> reverts to 0.  Thus,
    magnetic coupling and quasiparticle injection are not
    simultaneously available.

    The <tt>cct</tt> parameter can take one of the following values in

    The <tt>control</tt> instance parameter should be used with

    <tt>icon</tt>.  For <tt>cct</tt>=3, the maximum critical current
    is at control current zero, and it reduces linearly to zero at
    control current = &#177<tt>icon</tt>.  Junctions with
    <tt>cct</tt>=4 have maximum critical current at control current =
    -<tt>icon</tt>, and linear reduction to zero at control current =
    +<tt>icon</tt>.  If <tt>cct</tt> is specified as 2, 3, or 4, the
    area parameter, if given, is set to unity.  Otherwise, the model
    parameters are scaled appropriately by the area before use.

    This is a new parameter in the current model, which is intended to
    account for nonlinearity in scaling of capacitance with area (or
    critical current, we actually define "area" as the actual over the
    reference critical current).  It is anticipated that the actual
    junction capacitance consists of two components:  a physical area
    dependent "bulk" term, and a perimeter-dependent fringing term. 
    The <tt>cmu</tt> is a real number between 0 and 1 where if 0 we
    assume no perimeter dependence, and if 1 we assume that all
    variation scales with the perimeter.  The default value is 0.
    The capacitance of an instantiated junctions is as follows:
    <blockquote>
    C = cap(A(1-cmu) + &#8730;A cmu)

    Here, A is the "area" scaling factor, which is the ratio of the

    quality (higher is better).  Values tend to decrease with
    increasing critical current density.  This defaults to the value

    This is the product of the reference junction "normal state"

    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 1.0<br>
    This is analogous to <tt>cmu</tt>, and applies to the subgap and
    normal conductances.  The <tt>vm</tt>, in particular, may vary
    with junction physical size, with small junctions having lower
    <tt>vm</tt> than larger ones.  This parameter should capture this
    effect.  It is taken that a significant part of the conductivity
    is due to defects or imperfections around the periphery of the
    junction area, and the contribution would therefor scale with the
    perimeter.  The scaling for conductivity is as follows:
    <blockquote>
    G<sub>x</sub> = G<sub>x0</sub>(A(1-gmu) + &#8730;A gmu)
    </blockquote>
    Here, G<sub>x</sub> refers to either the subgap or normal
    conductance, G<sub>x0</sub> is the same parameter for the
    reference junction.  The A is the scaling parameter, that is, the
    ratio of instance to reference critical currents.  The default
    value is 0, meaning that scaling is assumed purely linear, which
    will be the case until a number is provided through additional
    data analysis.  It may prove necessary to have separate scaling
    parameters for subgap and above gap condutance, at which time a
    new model parameter may be added.

    This parameter is unique in that it does not describe an
    as-fabricated junction characteristic.  Rather, it is for
    convenience in specifying a shunt resistance to use globally in
    SFQ circuits, If given (in volts) conductance will be added
    automatically so that the product of the total subgap conductance
    and the critical current will equal <tt>vshunt</tt>.  This avoids
    having to calculate the value of and add an explicit resistor
    across each Josephson junction, as used for damping in these
    circuits.  The designer should choose a value consistent with the
    process parameters and the amount of damping required.  Higher
    values will provide less damping, usually critical damping is
    desired.  This parameter defaults to 0, meaning that no additional

    These parameters specify series parasitic inductance in the

    given a value such that the added external conductance is
    positive, or these parameters are ignored.  The inductance

    to 2&pi;.  If not given, it defaults to <tt>dphimax</tt>/2&pi; in

    <dt><tt>tsaccel</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 1.0 - 100.0<br>
    Time step limiting is performed relative to the Josephson
    frequency of the instantaneous absolute junction voltage or the
    dropback voltage, whichever is larger.  The phase change is
    limited by <tt>tsfactor</tt>, thus corresponding to a maximum time
    step relative to the period of the frequency corresponding to the
    voltage.  Note that in SFQ circuits, where the junctions are
    critically damped, the junction voltage is unlikely to exceed the
    dropback voltage, which is numerically equal to the critical
    current times the shunt resistance (<tt>vshunt</tt>).  This
    implies that the maximum time step is a fixed value by default.

    <p>
    When simulating SFQ circuits, between SFQ pulses there is often
    significant time where signals are quiescent and one could
    probably take larger time steps, speeding simulation.  This
    appears true to an extent, however one can see signs of
    instability if steps are too large.

    <p>
    The <tt>tsaccel</tt> parameter is the ratio of the longest time
    step allowed to that allowed at the dropback voltage.  In
    computing the time step, the low voltage threshold is reduced to
    the dropback voltage divided by <tt>tsaccel</tt>, so time steps
    will be inversely proportional to voltages above this value.

    RSFQ circuits, your results may vary.

    <h3>RSJ Model Temperature Dependence</h3>

    When the junction is not operating at the nominal temperature
    as specified with the <tt>tnom</tt> parameter, a correction factor
    is applied to the critical current to account for the temperature
    difference.  The superconducting energy gap and therefor the
    junction gap voltage will also change as a function of temperature.

    <p>
    If the gap voltage is not specified with the <tt>vg</tt> parameter
    or its alias <tt>vgap</tt>, the model will compute the gap voltage
    from BCS theory using the superconducting transition temperature
    (<tt>tc</tt> parameter) and Debye temperature (<tt>tdebye</tt>
    parameter) at the operating temperature.

    <p>
    When a gap voltage is supplied, it is taken as the value at the
    nominal temperature.  The model utilizes an interpolation formula
    to represent temperature variation of the gap parameter of the
    superconductor in the case.

    <p>
    In either case, the RSJ model currently assumes that the same
    material appears on either side of the barrier.

    <p>
    Below is the approximation formula for the superconducting energy
    gap that is employed when the nominal junction gap voltage is
    given explicitly.  The junction vap voltage is twice the
    superconductor energy gap.
    <blockquote>
    &Delta; = &Delta;<sub>0</sub> <i>tanh</i>(<tt>tcfct</tt>
    &radic;(<tt>tc</tt>/T - 1))
    </blockquote>
    Reference: <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/192416/interpolation-formula-for-bcs-superconducting-gap">
    <tt>https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/192416/interpolation-formula-for-bcs-superconducting-gap</tt></a>

    <p>
    Here, &Delta; is the energy gap, with the subscript indicating the
    value at temperature T=0.  The <tt>tcfct</tt> parameter is semi-empirical,
    commonly cited as 1.74, which is the default value.

    <p>
    In order to apply temperature correction one takes the assumption
    that parameters for the reference junction are measured at nominal
    temperature <tt>tnom</tt>, and we therefor have

    <blockquote>
    &Delta;<sub>nom</sub> = &Delta;<sub>0</sub> <i>tanh</i>(<tt>tcfct</tt>
    &radic;(<tt>tc</tt>/<tt>tnom</tt> - 1))
    </blockquote>

    The correction factor which will multiply device
    gap voltage, is the ratio &Delta;/&Delta;<sub>nom</sub>.
    This will apply when the nominal gap voltage is given.  When not
    given, the gap voltage is computed directly with BCS theory and the
    approximation formula is not used.

    <p>
    The critical current temperature variation again follows BCS theory.
    The temperature correction factor <i>tcf</i> multiplies the instance
    critical current to account for the temperature difference between
    operating and nominal temperatures.

    <blockquote>
    <i>tcf<i> = (Vg/Vg<sub>nom</sub>) *
     (<i>tanh</i>(<tt>eVg/4KT</tt>) /
     <i>tanh</i>(<tt>eVg</tt><sub>nom</sub><tt>/4KT</tt><sub>nom</sub>))
    </blockquote>

    Here, <tt>Vg</tt> is the computed gap voltage, <tt>e</tt> is the electron
    charge, <tt>K</tt> is Boltzmann's constant, <tt>T</tt> is temperature in
    Kelvin,

The default Josephson junction model is an extended version of the RSJ
model as used by Jewett\cite{jewett}.  There are actually three
Josephson junction models available, through the {\vt level} model
parameter, which can take values 1 through 3.  The default {\vt
level=1} model is the RSJ model mentioned.  This model has a
simplified Verilog-A version which can be found among the Verilog-A
examples.  This can be compiled with the {\vt adms} utility into a
run-time loadable module which can be loaded with the {\cb devload}
command.  A pre-compiled module is provided with the example.  Once
loaded into {\WRspice}, the model can be accessed with {\vt level=2}>.

For {\vt level=3}, a microscopic tunnel junction ``Werthamer'' model,
also known as a tunnel junction model (TJM) is provided.  The model is
more physics-based than the empirical RSJ model.

\subsubsection{Josephson Junction Model (RSJ Modxel)}
\index{RSJ model}

The parameters marked with an asterisk in the {\bf area} column scale
with the {\vt ics} parameter given in the device line, not necessarily
linearly.  The present model paradigm assumes that the model
parameters apply to a ``reference'' junction, which is a typical
mid-critical current device as produced by the fouhdry. 
Instantiations derive from the reference device for a desired critical
current.  Appropriate scaling, not necessarily linear, will be applied
when formulating instance capacitance and conductances.

RSJ model ({\vt level=1}) and the Verilog-A Josephson junction model
provided with {\WRspice} in the Verilog-A examples ({\vt level=2}).

\begin{description}
\item{\vt level}\\
This specifies the model to use.  There are three choices provided in
{\WRspice}.  Level 1 (the default) is the internal RSJ model, and
level 2 indicates the Verilog-A example RSJ model, which is available
if it has been loaded.  The third choice is level 3, which is an
internal microscopic tunnel junction model described in the next
section.

\item{\vt pijj}\\
If this flag is given a nonzero integer value, the junctions will be
modeled as a ``pi junction'' meaning that the zero-current phase is
$\pi$ rather than zero.  Such devices have been fabricated using
ferromagnetic barrier materials.  Although these devices have some
interesting behavior, they are not at this point available or used
with any frequency.

\item{\vt rtype}\\
The {\vt rtype} parameter determines the type of quasiparticle branch
modeling employed.  Legal values are listed below, only 0 and 1 are
supported in level 2.
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\bf 0 & The junction is completely unshunted, all shunt conductances
 set to zero.\\
\bf 1 & Standard model (the default).\\
\bf 2 & Analytic exponentially-derived approximation.\\
\bf 3 & Fifth order polynomial expansion model.\\
\bf 4 & ``Temperature'' variation, allow modulation of the gap parameter.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Values for {\vt rtype} larger than 1 are not currently supported in
the Verilog-A model supplied with {\WRspice} in the Verilog-A
examples.

The default is {\vt rtype=1}.  Setting {\vt rtype=0} will disable
modeling of the quasiparticle current, effectively setting the shunt
resistance to infinity.  Conditions with {\vt rtype=1} and {\vt 2} are
as described by Jewett, however it is not assumed that the normal
resistance projects through the origin.  The {\vt icfact} parameter
can be set to a value lower than the default BCS theoretical value to
reflect the behavior of most real junctions.  The quasiparticle
resistance is approximated with a fifth order polynomial if {\vt
rtype=3}, which seems to give good results for the modeling of some
NbN junctions (which tend to have gently sloping quasiparticle
curves).

{\vt Rtype=4} uses a piecewise-linear quasiparticle characteristic
identical to {\vt rtype=1}, however the gap voltage and critical
current are now proportional to the absolute value of the control
current set with a {\vt control=}{\it src\_name} entry in the device
line.  This is to facilitate modeling of temperature changes or
nonequilibrium effects.  For control current of 1 (Amp) or greater,
the full gap and critical current are used, otherwise they decrease
linearly to zero.  If no device control source is specified, the
algorithm reverts to {\vt rtype=1}.  It is expected that a nonlinear
transfer function will be implemented with a controlled source, which
will in turn provide the controlling current to the junction in this
mode.  For example, the controlling current can be translated from a
circuit voltage representing temperature with an external nonlinear
source.  The functional dependence is in general a complicated
function, but a reasonable approximation is $1 - (T/T_c)^4$.  See the
examples (\ref{examples}) for an example input file ({\vt ex10.cir})
which illustrates {\vt rtype=4}.

It is currently not possible to use other than the piecewise linear
model with this type of temperature variation.  If {\vt rtype=4}, then
legal values for the critical current parameter are {\vt cct=0} (no
critical current) and {\vt cct=1} (fixed critical current).  If
another value is specified for {\vt cct}, {\vt cct} reverts to 0. 
Thus, magnetic coupling and quasiparticle injection are not
simultaneously available.

\item{\vt cct}\\
The {\vt cct} parameter can take one of the following values in level
1, only 0 and 1 are supported in level 2.
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\bf 0 & No critical current.\\
\bf 1 & Fixed critical current.\\
\bf 2 & Sin(x)/x modulated supercurrent.\\
\bf 3 & Symmetric linear reduction modulation.\\
\bf 4 & Asymmetric linear reduction modulation.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

Values for {\vt cct} larger than 1 are not currently supported in the
Verilog-A model supplied with {\WRspice} in the Verilog-A examples.

The {\vt control} instance parameter should be used with devices using
{\vt cct} 2,3, or 4.  With {\vt cct=2}, the first zero is equal to the
value of the model parameter {\vt icon}.  For {\vt cct=3}, the maximum
critical current is at control current zero, and it reduces linearly
to zero at control current = $\pm icon$.  Junctions with {\vt cct=4}
have maximum critical current at control current = $-${\vt icon}, and
linear reduction to zero at control current = $+${\vt icon}.  If {\vt
cct} is specified as 2, 3, or 4, the area parameter, if given, is set
to unity.  Otherwise, the model parameters are scaled appropriately by
the area before use.

\item{\vt icon}\\
{\bf range:} 1e-4 -- 1.0\\
{\bf Level 1 only.}\\
This parameter applies when the {\vt cct} parameter is set to one of
the choices larger the 1, where critical current modulation is
modeled.  The value of {\vt icon} is the first value for (assumed)
full suppression of critical current.

The parameter is not currently recognized by the Verilog-A Josephson
junction model provided with {\WRspice}, as that model does not
currently support values of {\vt cct} larger than 1.

\item{\vt tc}\\
{\bf range:} 0.1K -- 280K\\
This is the transition temperature of the material used in the
Josephson junction.  We assume that both junction electrodes use the
same material.  The default value is 9.26K, the transition temperature
of niobium.

\item{\vt tdebye}\\
{\bf range:} 40K -- 500K\\
This is the Debye temperature of the material used in the Josephson
junction.  The default is 276K corresponding to niobium.  The model
support can compute the superconducting energy gap as a function of
temperature, transition temperature, and Debye temperature using a BCS
expression.

\item{\vt tnom}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0K -- 0.95*{\vt tc}\\
This is the temperature at which all model parameters are measured. 
The default is 4.2K, the boiling point of liquid helium.

\item{\vt deftemp}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0K -- 0.95*{\vt tc}\\
This is the default operating temperature of instances of the model,
which can be overridden on a per-instance basis by specifying the
{\vt temp\_k} instance parameter.  The default is the {\vt tnom}
value.

\item{\vt tcfct}\\
{\bf range:} 1.5 -- 2.5\\
This is an empirical fitting parameter for approximate temperature
dependence (see \ref{rsjtcf}) of the energy gap, default is 1.74.

\item{\vt icrit}\\
{\bf range:} 1nA -- 0.1A\\
This is the critical current of the reference junction at nominal
temperature, which defaults to 1.0mA if not given.  This parameter is
not used if {\vt cct} is 0.  the superconducting current through a
Josepjson junctions is
\begin{quote}
$I = I_c sin(\phi)$
\end{quote}
where $I_c$ is the critical current. and the junction ``phase'' is
\begin{quote}
$\phi = (2\pi/\Phi_0)\int^t_{-\infty} V(t)dt$ .
\end{quote}
The {\it V(t)} is the junction voltage, and $\Phi_0$ is the magnetic
flux quantum.

The {\vt icrit} parameter should not be confused with the
{\vt ics} instance parameter.  The latter is actually a scale
factor which specifies the instantiated device critical current as
well as appropriately scaling conductances and capacitance, from
the model reference current which is {\vt icrit}.

\item{{\vt vg} or {\vt vgap}}\\
{\bf range:} 0.1mV -- 10.0mV\\
This parameter specifies the gap voltage, which in a hysteretic
Josephson junction is a voltage at which there is a large and abrupt
increase in conductivity.  This parameter is material dependent.  If
not given, the value used is computed using BCS theory from the
operating temperature, superconducting transition temperature, and
Debye temperature, assuming both electrodes are identical.

\item{\vt delv}\\
{\bf range:} $0.001{\vt vg}$ -- $0.2{\vt vg}$\\
This specifies the assumed width, in voltage, of the quasiparticle
step region, or gap.  In this region, current increases sharply with
increasing voltage.  The default value of 80uV is reasonable for
high-quality niobium/aluminum oxide Josephson junctions independent of
foundry.

\item{\vt cap}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1nF\\
This is the capacitance of the reference junction, in farads.  This
will override the {\vt cpic} parameter if given, setting a fixed value
for reference junction capacitance, invariant with {\vt icrit}.  If
not given, junction specific capacitance is set via the {\vt cpic}
parameter, see below.

\item{\vt cpic}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1e-9\\
This supplies the default capacitance per critical current in F/A. 
This defaults to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process <a
href="tolpygo">[Tolpygo]</a> value (0.7pF for 1.0 mA), and will set
the junction capacitance if <tt>cap</tt> is not given.  With
<tt>cap</tt> not given, changing <tt>icrit</tt> will change the
assumed capacitance of the reference junction.

\item{\vt cmu}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1.0\\
This is a new parameter in the current model, which is intended to
account for nonlinearity in scaling of capacitance with area (or
critical current, we actually define ``area'' as the actual over the
reference critical current).  It is anticipated that the actual
junction capacitance consists of two components:  a physical area
dependent ``bulk'' term, and a perimeter-dependent fringing term.  The
{\vt cmu} is a real number between 0 and 1 where if 0 we assume no
perimeter dependence, and if 1 we assume that all variation scales
with the perimeter.  The default value is 0.  The capacitance of an
instantiated junctions is as follows:
\begin{quote}
$C = cap (A(1-cmu) + \sqrt{A} cmu)$
\end{quote}
Here, $A$ is the ``area'' scaling factor, which is the ratio of the
junction critical current to the reference critical current.

\item{\vt vm}\\
{\bf range:} 8mV -- 100mV\\
This is the product of the reference subgap resistance and the
reference device critical current.  This parameter is commonly
provided by foundries, and is a standard indicator for junction
quality (higher is better).  Values tend to decrease with increasing
critical current density.  This defaults to the value for the MIT
Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process\cite{tolpygo}, which is 16.5mV, The
reference junction subgap resistance is obtained from the value of
this parameter and the critical current, unless given explicitly.

\item{{\vt rsub} or {\vt r0}}\\
{\bf range:} 8mV/{\vt icrit} -- 100mV/{\vt icrit}\\
The reference junction subgap resistance can be given directly
with this parameter, and a given value will override the
{\vt vm} value if also given.

\item{\vt icrn}\\
{\bf range:} 1.5mV -- 1.9mV\\
This is the product of the reference junction ``normal state''
resistance and the critical current, where the normal state resistance
is the differential resistance measured well above the gap.  The
default value is that provided for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE
process\cite{tolpygo} which is 1.65mV.  This too is a commonly given
parameter from Josephson foundries for characterizing junctions.  If
not specified explicitly, this provides the reference junction normal
state resistance from the critical current.

\item{{\vt rnorm} or {\vt rn}}\\
{\bf range:} 1.5mV/{\vt icrit} -- 1.9mV/{\vt icrit}\\
The reference junction normal state resistance can be given explicitly
with this parameter, which will override {\vt icrn} if this is also
given.

\item{\vt gmu}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1.0\\
This is analogous to {\vt cmu}, and applies to the subgap and normal
conductances.  The {\vt vm}, in particular, may vary with junction
physical size, with small junctions having lower {\vt vm} than larger
ones.  This parameter should capture this effect.  It is taken that a
significant part of the conductivity is due to defects or
imperfections around the periphery of the junction area, and the
contribution would therefor scale with the perimeter.  The scaling for
conductivity is as follows:
\begin{quote}
$G_x = G_{x0} (A(1-gmu) + \sqrt{A} gmu)$
\end{quote}
Here, $G_x$ refers to either the subgap or normal conductance,
$G_{x0}$ is the same parameter for the reference junction.  The $A$ is
the scaling parameter, that is, the ratio of instance to reference
critical currents.  The default value is 0, meaning that scaling is
assumed purely linear, which will be the case until a number is
provided through additional data analysis.  It may prove necessary to
have separate scaling parameters for subgap and above gap condutance,
at which time a new model parameter may be added.

\item{{\vt icfct} or {\vt icfact}}\\
{\bf range:} 0.5 -- ${\pi}/4$\\
This parameter sets the ratio of the critical current to the
quasiparticle step height.  Theory provides the default value of
$\pi/4$ which is usually adequately close.  Characterization of
fabricated junctions would provide an improved number.

\item{\vt force}\\
{\bf range:} 0 or 1\\
If this flag is set, then the only range test applied to subgap and
above gap resistance values is that they be larger than zero.  This
affects the parameters that set the quasiparticle branch conductance
values, any input other than a short circuit is allowed.

\item{\vt vshunt}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- nominal gap voltage\\
This parameter is unique in that it does not describe an as-fabricated
junction characteristic.  Rather, it is for convenience in specifying
a shunt resistance to use globally in SFQ circuits, If given (in
volts) conductance will be added automatically so that the product of
the total subgap conductance and the critical current will equal {\vt
vshunt}.  This avoids having to calculate the value of and add an
explicit resistor across each Josephson junction, as used for damping
in these circuits.  The designer should choose a value consistent with
the process parameters and the amount of damping required.  Higher
values will provide less damping, usually critical damping is desired. 
This parameter defaults to 0, meaning that no additional demping is
supplied by default.

\item{\vt lsh0}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 2.0pH
\item{\vt lsh1}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 10.0pH/${\Omega}$\\
These parameters specify series parasitic inductance in the external
shunt resistor.  the {\vt vshunt} parameter must be given a value such
that the added external conductance is positive, or these parameters
are ignored.  The inductance consists of a constant part ({\vt lsh0})
assumed to come from resistor contacts, plus a value ({\vt lsh1})
proportional to the resistance in ohms, intended to capture the length
dependence.

\item{\vt tsfactor}\\
{\bf range:} 0.001 -- 1.0\\
This is mainly for compatibility with the Verilog-A Josephson junction
model provided with {\WRspice} in the Verilog-A examples.  This is
equivalent to the {\WRspice} {\vt dphimax} parameter, but is
normalized to $2\pi$.  If not given, it defaults to ${\vt dphimax}/2\pi$
in {\WRspice}, or 0.1 in the Verilog-A model not used in {\WRspice}. 
This is the maximum phase change allowed between internal time points. 

\item{\vt tsaccel}\\
{\bf range:} 1.0 -- 100.0\\
Time step limiting is performed relative to the Josephson frequency of
the instantaneous absolute junction voltage or the dropback voltage,
whichever is larger.  The phase change is limited by {\vt tsfactor},
thus corresponding to a maximum time step relative to the period of
the frequency corresponding to the voltage.  Note that in SFQ
circuits, where the junctions are critically damped, the junction
voltage is unlikely to exceed the dropback voltage, which is
numerically equal to the critical current times the shunt resistance
({\vt vshunt}).  This implies that the maximum time step is a fixed
value by default.

When simulating SFQ circuits, between SFQ pulses there is often
significant time where signals are quiescent and one could probably
take larger time steps, speeding simulation.  This appears true to an
extent, however one can see signs of instability if steps are too
large.

The {\vt tsaccel} parameter is the ratio of the longest time step
allowed to that allowed at the dropback voltage.  In computing the
time step, the low voltage threshold is reduced to the dropback
voltage divided by {\vt tsaccel}, so time steps will be inversely
proportional to voltages above this value.

Experimentation suggests that a value of 2.5 is a good choice for RSFQ
circuits, your results may vary.

\item{\vt vdp} (read only)\\
This parameter returns the computed value of the dropback voltage,
which is the voltage at which the return trace of a hysteretic
Josephson junction i-v curve snaps back to the zero-voltage state.  If
is also the voltage equivalent of the plasma resonance, and the
product of critical current and shunt resistance for critical damping.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{RSJ Model Temperature Dependence}
\label{rsjtcf}

When the junction is not operating at the nominal temperature as
specified with the {\vt tnom} parameter, a correction factor is
applied to the critical current to account for the temperature
difference.  The superconducting energy gap and therefor the junction
gap voltage will also change as a function of temperature.

If the gap voltage is not specified with the {\vt vg} parameter or its
alias {\vt vgap}, the model will compute the gap voltage from BCS
theory using the superconducting transition temperature ({\vt tc}
parameter) and Debye temperature ({\vt tdebye} parameter) at the
operating temperature.

When a gap voltage is supplied, it is taken as the value at the
nominal temperature.  The model utilizes an interpolation formula to
represent temperature variation of the gap parameter of the
superconductor in the case.

In either case, the RSJ model currently assumes that the same
material appears on either side of the barrier.

Below is the approximation formula for the superconducting energy gap
that is employed when the nominal junction gap voltage is given
explicitly.  The junction vap voltage is twice the superconductor
energy gap.
\begin{quote}
$\Delta = \Delta_0 tanh(tcfct\sqrt(tc/T-1))$
\end{quote}
Reference: {\vt https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/192416/\\
interpolation-formula-for-bcs-superconducting-gap}

Here, $\Delta$ is the gap parameter, with the subscript indicating the
value at temperature T=0.  The {\vt tcfct} parameter is
semi-empirical, commonly cited as 1.74, which is the default value. 

In order to apply temperature correction one takes the assumption that
parameters for the reference junction are measured at nominal
temperature {\vt tnom}, and we therefor have

\begin{quote}
$\Delta_{nom} = \Delta_0 tanh(tcfct\sqrt(tc/tnom-1))$
\end{quote}

The correction factor, which will multiply device gap voltage, is the
ratio $\Delta/\Delta_{nom}$.  This will apply when the nominal gap
voltage is given.  When not given, the gap voltage is computed
directly with BCS theory and the approximation formula is not used.

The critical current temperature variation again follows BCS theory. 
The temperature correction factor {\it tcf} multiplies the instance
critical current to account for the temperature difference between
operating and nominal temperatures.

\begin{quote}
$tcf = (Vg/Vg_{nom})(tanh(eVg/4KT)/tanh(eVg_{nom}/4KT_{nom}))$
\end{quote}

Here, $Vg$ is the computed gap voltage, $e$ is the electron charge,
$K$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin,

Josephson Tunnel Junction Model

    <b>Type Name:</b> <tt>jj</tt> (<tt>level=3</tt>)

    <p>
    For <tt>level=3</tt>, a microscopic tunnel junction "Werthamer"
    model, also known as a tunnel junction model (TJM) is indicated. 
    The model is more physics-based that the empirical <a
    href="jjmodel">RSJ model</a>.  The formulation follows the method of
    <blockquote>
    A. A. Odintsov, V. K. Semenov and A. B. Zorin, IEEE Trans. Magn. 23,
    763 (1987).
    </blockquote>
    as implemented in the the open-source MitMoJCo project on <a
    href="https://github.com/drgulevich/mitmojco"><tt>https://github.com/drgulevich/mitmojco</tt></a>. 
    The actual model computations make use of predefined fitting
    parameters that can be produced with the <a
    href="mmjco"><b>mmjco</b></a> program provided with
    <i>WRspice</i>.  The <b>mmjco</b> program integrates the tunneling
    current expressions producing a tunnel current amplitude (TCA)
    table.  This is compressed into a smaller representation using the
    OSZ approach in the reference, which in addition to saving memory
    allows rapid evaluation of the model expressions, basically
    replacing a required integration by a short series expansion. 
    Thus model evaluation can be relatively inexpensive, though it is
    not as fast as the simple RSJ model.

    <p>
    The parameters marked with an asterisk in the <b>area</b> column
    scale with the <tt>ics</tt> parameter given in the device line,
    not necessarily linearly.  The present model paradigm assumes that
    the model parameters apply to a "reference" junction, which is a
    typical mid-critical current device as produced by the fouhdry. 
    Instantiations derive from the reference device for a desired
    critical current.  Appropriate scaling, not necessarily linear,
    will be applied when formulating instance capacitance and
    conductances.

    This provides the name of the table of compressed tunnel current
    amplitudes to use in the model.  These are provided as files as
    produced from the <a href="mmjco"><b>mmjco</b></a> utility
    provided with <i>WRspice</i>.  Single temperature ".fit" files
    will overrule any other temperatures provided to the model.  If a
    tempature-swept ".swp" file is provided, the model is able to
    accommodate temperatures within the range of the sweep.  The files
    are searched for along a path provided by setting the <a
    href="tjm_path"><tt>tjm_path</tt></a> variable, or a path can be
    provided directly.  The default is to search the current directory
    and <tt>$HOME/.mmjco</tt> if that directory exists.

    <p>
    These files are produced automatically as needed according to the
    given model parameters and cached in the users <tt>.mmjco</tt>

    load a set by name, except to supply a name for a sweep file that
    the user has prepared with <tt>mmjco</tt> which would provide
    precomputed data for all temperatures that might be of use,
    thereby avoiding on-the-fly table creation which can take some
    time.

    <p>
    There are two built-in coefficient sets, "tjm1" (the default) and
    "tjm2".  These are the MitMoJCo <tt>NbNb_4k2_008</tt> and
    <tt>NbNb_4K2_001</tt> parameter sets, respectively.  Both assume
    niobium at temperature 4.2K and differ in the level of smoothing
    applied to mitigate the Riedel singularity.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>rtype</tt><dd>
    For the tunnel junction model, <tt>rtype</tt> is a flag, set by

    This is the default operating temperature of instances of the

    the <tt>tnom</tt> value.

    <dt><tt>tc</tt>, <tt>tc1</tt>, <tt>tc2</tt><dd>

    This is the superconducting transition temperature of the
    material(s) used in the Josephson junction.  The default value is
    9.26K, the transition temperature of niobium.  The transition
    temperature may be set separately on side 1 and side 2 of the
    junction using the <tt>tc1</tt> and <tt>tc2</tt> keywords.  The
    <tt>tc</tt> keyword sets both sides.  If ambiguous, the last real

    This is the Debye temperature of the material(s) used in the
    Josephson junction.  The default is 276K corresponding to niobium. 
    As for the transition temperature, the two sides of the junction
    can be set independently.  The model support computes the
    superconducting energy gap as a function of temperature,
    transition temperature, and Debye temperature using a BCS
    expression.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>smf</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.001 - 0.099<br>
    This is a smoothing factor used when constructing the tunnel
    current amplitude tables, the use of which eliminates the Riedel
    singularity.  The default value is 0.008.  Higher values have
    larger smoothing, reducing the impact of the peaks at the gap.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>nterms</tt><dd>

    The computed tunnel current amplitude tables are compressed to
    tables having this many terms.  The more terms that are included,
    the more accurate are the parameter sets.  However, the time to
    prepare the fit tables grows rapidly with the number of terms. 
    The default number of terms is 8, which seems to provide
    reasonable accuracy.

    This sets the number of energy values over which the tunnel

    Points are computed between zero and twice the junction gap
    energy.  More points may provide more accurate results.

    <dt><tt>thr</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.1 - 0.5<br>
    This is the ratio of absolute to relative tolerance used in the

    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>icrit</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 1nA = 0.1A<br>
    This is the critical current of the reference junction at nominal
    temperature, which defaults to 1.0mA if not given.  This parameter
    is not used if <tt>cct</tt> is 0.  The <tt>icrit</tt> parameter
    should not be confused with the <tt>ics</tt> instance parameter. 
    The latter is actually a scale factor which specifies the
    instantiated device critical current as well as appropriately
    scaling conductances and capacitance, from the model reference
    current which is <tt>icrit</tt>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>cap</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 1nF<br>
    This is the capacitance of the reference junction, in farads. 
    This will override the <tt>cpic</tt> parameter if given, setting a
    fixed value for reference junction capacitance, invariant with
    <tt>icrit</tt>.  If not given, junction specific capacitance is
    set via the <tt>cpic</tt> parameter, see below.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>cpic</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 1e-6<br>
    This supplies the default capacitance per critical current in F/A. 
    This defaults to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process <a
    href="tolpygo">[Tolpygo]</a> value (0.7pF for 1.0 mA), and will
    set the junction capacitance if <tt>cap</tt> is not given.  With
    <tt>cap</tt> not given, changing <tt>icrit</tt> will change the
    assumed capacitance of the reference junction.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>cmu</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 1.0<br>
    This parameter is intended to account for nonlinearity in scaling
    of capacitance with area (or critical current, we actually define
    "area" as the actual over the reference critical current).  It is
    anticipated that the actual junction capacitance consists of two
    components:  a physical area dependent "bulk" term, and a
    perimeter-dependent fringing term.  The <tt>cmu</tt> is a real
    number between 0 and 1 where if 0 we assume no perimeter
    dependence, and if 1 we assume that all variation scales with the
    perimeter.  The default value is 0.  The capacitance of an
    instantiated junctions is as follows:
    <blockquote>
    C = cap(A(1-cmu) + &#8730;A cmu)
    </blockquote>
    Here, A is the "area" scaling factor, which is the ratio of the
    junction critical current to the reference critical current.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vm</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b>8mV - 100mV, or 0<br>
    This is the product of the reference subgap resistance and the
    reference device critical current.  This parameter is commonly
    provided by foundries, and is a standard indicator for junction
    quality (higher is better).  Values tend to decrease with
    increasing critical current density.  This defaults to the value
    for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process <a
    href="tolpygo">[Tolpygo]</a>, which is 16.5mV, The reference
    junction subgap resistance is obtained from the value of this
    parameter and the critical current, unless given explicitly.

    <p>
    The intrinsic subgap conductivity will be subtracted if smaller
    than the given <tt>vm</tt> implies.  If <tt>vm</tt> is set to 0,
    then no additional conductivity will be added and only the
    intrinsic conductivity will be seen.  Often, the intrinsic subgap
    conductivity is much smaller than observed in real junctions.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>rsub</tt> or <tt>r0</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 8mV/<tt>icrit</tt> - 100mV/<tt>icrit</tt>, or 0<br>
    The reference junction subgap resistance can be given directly
    with this parameter, and a given value will override the
    <tt>vm</tt> value if also given.

    <p>
    The subgap conductance will be reduced by the intrinsic condutance
    if this is smaller.  If <tt>vm</tt> is given as 0 and this
    parameter is not given, the parameter value will be 0.  If the
    value is 0, no additional conductance will be added.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>gmu</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 1.0<br>
    This is analogous to <tt>cmu</tt>, and applies to the subgap
    conductance.  The <tt>vm</tt>, in particular, may vary with
    junction physical size, with small junctions having lower
    <tt>vm</tt> than larger ones.  This parameter should capture this
    effect.  It is taken that a significant part of the conductivity
    is due to defects or imperfections around the periphery of the
    junction area, and the contribution would therefor scale with the
    perimeter.  The scaling for conductivity is as follows:
    <blockquote>
    G<sub>s</sub> = G<sub>s0</sub>(A(1-gmu) + &#8730;A gmu)
    </blockquote>
    Here, G<sub>s</sub> refers to the subgap conductance,
    G<sub>s0</sub> is the same parameter for the reference junction. 
    The A is the scaling parameter, that is, the ratio of instance to
    reference critical currents.  The default value is 0, meaning that
    scaling is assumed purely linear, which will be the case until a
    number is provided through additional data analysis.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>icfct</tt> or <tt>icfact</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.5 - &pi;/4<br>
    This parameter sets the ratio of the critical current to the
    quasiparticle step height.  Theory provides the default value of
    &pi;/4 which is usually adequately close.  Characterization of
    fabricated junctions would provide an improved number.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>force</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0 or 1<br>
    If this flag is set, then the only range test applied to subgap
    resistance values is that they be larger than zero.  This affects
    the parameters that set the quasiparticle branch conductance
    values, any input other than a short circuit is allowed.
    </dl>

    <a name="vshunt"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vshunt</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - nominal gap voltage<br>
    This parameter is unique in that it does not describe an
    as-fabricated junction characteristic.  Rather, it is for
    convenience in specifying a shunt resistance to use globally in
    SFQ circuits, If given (in volts) conductance will be added
    automatically so that the product of the total subgap conductance
    and the critical current will equal <tt>vshunt</tt>.  This avoids
    having to calculate the value of and add an explicit resistor
    across each Josephson junction, as used for damping in these
    circuits.  The designer should choose a value consistent with the
    process parameters and the amount of damping required.  Higher
    values will provide less damping, usually critical damping is
    desired.  This parameter defaults to 0, meaning that no additional
    demping is supplied by default.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>lsh0</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 2.0pH<br>
    <dt><tt>lsh1</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.0 - 10.0pH/ohm<br>
    These parameters specify series parasitic inductance in the
    external shunt resistor.  the <tt>vshunt</tt> parameter must be
    given a value such that the added external conductance is
    positive, or these parameters are ignored.  The inductance
    consists of a constant part (<tt>lsh0</tt>) assumed to come from
    resistor contacts, plus a value (<tt>lsh1</tt>) proportional to
    the resistance in ohms, intended to capture the length dependence.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>tsfactor</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 0.001 - 1.0<br>
    This is mainly for compatibility with the Verilog-A Josephson
    junction model provided with <i>WRspice</i> in the Verilog-A
    examples.  This is equivalent to the <i>WRspice</i> <a
    href="dphimax"><tt>dphimax</tt></a> parameter, but is normalized
    to 2&pi;.  If not given, it defaults to <tt>dphimax</tt>/2&pi; in
    <i>WRspice</i>, or 0.1 in the Verilog-A model not used in
    <i>WRspice</i>.  This is the maximum phase change allowed between
    internal time points.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>tsaccel</tt><dd>
    <b>range:</b> 1.0 - 100.0<br>
    Time step limiting is performed relative to the Josephson
    frequency of the instantaneous absolute junction voltage or the
    dropback voltage, whichever is larger.  The phase change is
    limited by <tt>tsfactor</tt>, thus corresponding to a maximum time
    step relative to the period of the frequency corresponding to the
    voltage.  Note that in SFQ circuits, where the junctions are
    critically damped, the junction voltage is unlikely to exceed the
    dropback voltage, which is numerically equal to the critical
    current times the shunt resistance (<tt>vshunt</tt>).  This
    implies that the maximum time step is a fixed value by default.

    <p>
    When simulating SFQ circuits, between SFQ pulses there is often
    significant time where signals are quiescent and one could
    probably take larger time steps, speeding simulation.  This
    appears true to an extent, however one can see signs of
    instability if steps are too large.

    <p>
    The <tt>tsaccel</tt> parameter is the ratio of the longest time
    step allowed to that allowed at the dropback voltage.  In
    computing the time step, the low voltage threshold is reduced to
    the dropback voltage divided by <tt>tsaccel</tt>, so time steps
    will be inversely proportional to voltages above this value.

    <p>
    Experimentation suggests that a value of 2.5 is a good choice for
    RSFQ circuits, your results may vary.

    <h3>TJM Model Temperature Dependence</h3>

    When the junction is not operating at the nominal temperature
    as specified with the <tt>tnom</tt> parameter, a correction factor
    is applied to the critical current to account for the temperature
    difference.  The superconducting energy gap and therefor the
    junction gap voltage will also change as a function of temperature.

    <p>
    In the TJM model, the energy gaps are always computed from the BCS
    integral equation involving superconducting transition temperature,
    Debye temperature, and operating temperature.  The materials may be
    different on the two sides of the barrier.  The junction gap voltage
    is the sum of the gap potentials of the two materials.

    <p>
    The critical current temperature variation again follows BCS theory.
    The temperature correction factor <i>tcf</i> multiplies the instance
    critical current to account for the temperature difference between
    operating and nominal temperatures.

    <blockquote>
    <i>tcf<i> = (Vg/Vg<sub>nom</sub>) *
     (<i>tanh</i>(<tt>eVg/4KT</tt>) /
     <i>tanh</i>(<tt>eVg</tt><sub>nom</sub><tt>/4KT</tt><sub>nom</sub>))
    </blockquote>

    Here, <tt>Vg</tt> is the computed gap voltage, <tt>e</tt> is the electron
    charge, <tt>K</tt> is Boltzmann's constant, <tt>T</tt> is temperature in
    Kelvin,

For {\vt level=3}, a microscopic tunnel junction "Werthamer" model,
also known as a tunnel junction model (TJM) is indicated.  The model
is more physics-based that the empirical RSJ model.  The formulation
follows the method of
\begin{quote}

763 (1987).
\end{quote}
as implemented in the the open-source MitMoJCo project on {\vt
https://github.com/drgulevich/mitmojco}.  The actual model
computations make use of predefined fitting parameters that can be
produced with the {\vt mmjco} program provided with {\WRspice}
(\ref{mmjco}).  The {\vt mmjco} program integrates the tunneling
current expressions producing a tunnel current amplitude (TCA) table. 
This is compressed into a smaller representation using the OSZ
approach in the reference, which in addition to saving memory allows
rapid evaluation of the model expressions, basically replacing a
required integration by a short series expansion.  Thus model
evaluation can be relatively inexpensive, though it is not as fast as
the simple RSJ model.

The parameters marked with an asterisk in the {\bf area} column scale
with the {\vt ics} parameter given in the device line, not necessarily
linearly.  The present model paradigm assumes that the model
parameters apply to a ``reference'' junction, which is a typical
mid-critical current device as produced by the fouhdry. 
Instantiations derive from the reference device for a desired critical
current.  Appropriate scaling, not necessarily linear, will be applied
when formulating instance capacitance and conductances.

Detailed information about these parameters is presented below. 

\begin{description}
\item{\vt level}\\
This specifies the model to use, which is 3 in the present case.

\item{\vt coeffset}\\
This provides the name of the table of compressed tunnel current
amplitudes to use in the model.  These are provided as files as
produced from the {\vt mmjco} utility provided with {\WRspice} (see
\ref{mmjco}).  Single temperature ``.fit'' files will overrule any
other temperatures provided to the model.  If a tempature-swept
``.swp'' file is provided, the model is able to accommodate
temperatures within the range of the sweep.  The files are searched
for along a path provided by setting the {\et tjm\_path} variable, or
a path can be provided directly.  The default is to search the current
directory and {\vt \$HOME/.mmjco} if that directory exists.

These files are produced automatically as needed according to the
given model parameters and cached in the users {\vt .mmjco} directory. 
Therefor it is not common to use this parameter to load a set by name,
except to supply a name for a sweep file that the user has prepared
with {\vt mmjco} which would provide precomputed data for all
temperatures that might be of use, thereby avoiding on-the-fly table
creation which can take some time.

There are two built-in coefficient sets, ``tjm1'' (the default) and
``tjm2''.  These are the MitMoJCo {\vt NbNb\_4k2\_008} and {\vt
NbNb\_4K2\_001} parameter sets, respectively.  Both assume niobium at
temperature 4.2K and differ in the level of smoothing applied to
mitigate the Riedel singularity.
</dl>

\item{\vt rtype}\\
For the tunnel junction model, {\vt rtype} is a flag, set by default,
that enables inclusion of the quasiparticle current.  If set to 0,
quasiparticle current will not be included in the model.

\item{\vt cct}\\
For the tunnel junction model, {\vt cct} is a flag, set by default,
that enables inclusion of the pair current.  If set to 0, pair current
will not be included in the model.

\item{\vt tnom}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0K -- 0.95*{\vt tc}\\
This is the temperature at which all model parameters are measured. 
The default is 4.2K, the boiling point of liquid helium.

\item{\vt deftemp}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0K -- 0.95*{\vt tc}\\
This is the default operating temperature of instances of the model,
which can be overridden on a per-instance basis by specifying the
{\vt temp\_k} instance parameter.  The default is the {\vt tnom}
value.

\item{\vt tc}, {\vt tc1}, {\vt tc2}\\
{\bf range:} 0.1K -- 280K\\
This is the superconducting transition temperature of the material(s)
used in the Josephson junction.  The default value is 9.26K, the
transition temperature of niobium.  The transition temperature may be
set separately on side 1 and side 2 of the junction using the {\vt
tc1} and {\vt tc2} keywords.  The {\vt tc} keyword sets both sides. 
If ambiguous, the last real or implied setting has precedence.

\item{\vt tdebye}, {\vt tdebye1}, {\vt tdebye2}\\
{\bf range:} 40K -- 500K\\
This is the Debye temperature of the material(s) used in the Josephson
junction.  The default is 276K corresponding to niobium.  As for the
transition temperature, the two sides of the junction can be set
independently.  The model support computes the superconducting energy
gap as a function of temperature, transition temperature, and Debye
temperature using a BCS expression.

\item{\vt smf}\\
{\bf range:} 0.001 -- 0.099\\
This is a smoothing factor used when constructing the tunnel current
amplitude tables, the use of which eliminates the Riedel singularity. 
The default value is 0.008.  Higher values have larger smoothing,
reducing the impact of the peaks at the gap.

\item{\vt nterms}\\
{\bf range:} 6 -- 20\\
The computed tunnel current amplitude tables are compressed to tables
having this many terms.  The more terms that are included, the more
accurate are the parameter sets.  However, the time to prepare the fit
tables grows rapidly with the number of terms.  The default number of
terms is 8, which seems to provide reasonable accuracy.

\item{\vt nxpts}\\
{\bf range:} 100 -- 9999\\
This sets the number of energy values over which the tunnel current
amplitude tables are computed.  The default is 500.  Points are
computed between zero and twice the junction gap energy.  More points
may provide more accurate results.

\item{\vt thr}\\
{\bf range:} 0.1 -- 0.5\\
This is the ratio of absolute to relative tolerance used in the table
compression algorithm.  The default value of 0.2 seems to give good
results.

\item{\vt icrit}\\
{\bf range:} 1nA -- 0.1A\\
This is the critical current of the reference junction at nominal
temperature, which defaults to 1.0mA if not given.  This parameter is
not used if {\vt cct} is 0.  The {\vt icrit} parameter should not be
confused with the {\vt ics} instance parameter.  The latter is
actually a scale factor which specifies the instantiated device
critical current as well as appropriately scaling conductances and
capacitance, from the model reference current which is {\vt icrit}.

\item{\vt cap}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1nF\\
This is the capacitance of the reference junction, in farads.  This
will override the {\vt cpic} parameter if given, setting a fixed value
for reference junction capacitance, invariant with {\vt icrit}.  If
not given, junction specific capacitance is set via the {\vt cpic}
parameter, see below.

\item{\vt cpic}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1e-9\\
This supplies the default capacitance per critical current in F/A. 
This defaults to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process <a
href="tolpygo">[Tolpygo]</a> value (0.7pF for 1.0 mA), and will set
the junction capacitance if <tt>cap</tt> is not given.  With
<tt>cap</tt> not given, changing <tt>icrit</tt> will change the
assumed capacitance of the reference junction.

\item{\vt cmu}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1.0\\
This is a new parameter in the current model, which is intended to
account for nonlinearity in scaling of capacitance with area (or
critical current, we actually define ``area'' as the actual over the
reference critical current).  It is anticipated that the actual
junction capacitance consists of two components:  a physical area
dependent ``bulk'' term, and a perimeter-dependent fringing term.  The
{\vt cmu} is a real number between 0 and 1 where if 0 we assume no
perimeter dependence, and if 1 we assume that all variation scales
with the perimeter.  The default value is 0.  The capacitance of an
instantiated junctions is as follows:
\begin{quote}
$C = cap (A(1-cmu) + \sqrt{A} cmu)$
\end{quote}
Here, $A$ is the ``area'' scaling factor, which is the ratio of the
junction critical current to the reference critical current.

\item{\vt vm}\\
{\bf range:} 8mV -- 100mV, or 0\\
This is the product of the reference subgap resistance and the
reference device critical current.  This parameter is commonly
provided by foundries, and is a standard indicator for junction
quality (higher is better).  Values tend to decrease with increasing
critical current density.  This defaults to the value for the MIT
Lincoln Laboratory SFQ5EE process\cite{tolpygo}, which is 16.5mV, The
reference junction subgap resistance is obtained from the value of
this parameter and the critical current, unless given explicitly.

The intrinsic subgap conductivity will be subtracted if smaller than
the given {\vt vm} implies.  If {\vt vm} is set to 0, then no
additional conductivity will be added and only the intrinsic
conductivity will be seen.  Often, the intrinsic subgap conductivity
is much smaller than observed in real junctions.

\item{{\vt rsub} or {\vt r0}}\\
{\bf range:} 8mV/{\vt icrit} -- 100mV/{\vt icrit}, or 0\\
The reference junction subgap resistance can be given directly
with this parameter, and a given value will override the
{\vt vm} value if also given.

The subgap conductance will be reduced by the intrinsic condutance if
this is smaller.  If {\vt vm} is given as 0 and this parameter is not
given, the parameter value will be 0.  If the value is 0, no
additional conductance will be added.

\item{\vt gmu}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 1.0\\
This is analogous to {\vt cmu}, and applies to the subgap and normal
conductances.  The {\vt vm}, in particular, may vary with junction
physical size, with small junctions having lower {\vt vm} than larger
ones.  This parameter should capture this effect.  It is taken that a
significant part of the conductivity is due to defects or
imperfections around the periphery of the junction area, and the
contribution would therefor scale with the perimeter.  The scaling for
conductivity is as follows:
\begin{quote}
$G_x = G_{x0} (A(1-gmu) + \sqrt{A} gmu)$
\end{quote}
Here, $G_x$ refers to either the subgap or normal conductance,
$G_{x0}$ is the same parameter for the reference junction.  The $A$ is
the scaling parameter, that is, the ratio of instance to reference
critical currents.  The default value is 0, meaning that scaling is
assumed purely linear, which will be the case until a number is
provided through additional data analysis.  It may prove necessary to
have separate scaling parameters for subgap and above gap condutance,
at which time a new model parameter may be added.

\item{{\vt icfct} or {\vt icfact}}\\
{\bf range:} 0.5 -- ${\pi}/4$\\
This parameter sets the ratio of the critical current to the
quasiparticle step height.  Theory provides the default value of
$\pi/4$ which is usually adequately close.  Characterization of
fabricated junctions would provide an improved number.

\item{\vt force}\\
{\bf range:} 0 or 1\\
If this flag is set, then the only range test applied to subgap
resistance values is that they be larger than zero.  This affects the
parameters that set the quasiparticle branch conductance values, any
input other than a short circuit is allowed.

\item{\vt vshunt}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- nominal gap voltage\\
This parameter is unique in that it does not describe an as-fabricated
junction characteristic.  Rather, it is for convenience in specifying
a shunt resistance to use globally in SFQ circuits, If given (in
volts) conductance will be added automatically so that the product of
the total subgap conductance and the critical current will equal {\vt
vshunt}.  This avoids having to calculate the value of and add an
explicit resistor across each Josephson junction, as used for damping
in these circuits.  The designer should choose a value consistent with
the process parameters and the amount of damping required.  Higher
values will provide less damping, usually critical damping is desired. 
This parameter defaults to 0, meaning that no additional demping is
supplied by default.

\item{\vt lsh0}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 2.0pH
\item{\vt lsh1}\\
{\bf range:} 0.0 -- 10.0pH/${\Omega}$\\
These parameters specify series parasitic inductance in the external
shunt resistor.  the {\vt vshunt} parameter must be given a value such
that the added external conductance is positive, or these parameters
are ignored.  The inductance consists of a constant part ({\vt lsh0})
assumed to come from resistor contacts, plus a value ({\vt lsh1})
proportional to the resistance in ohms, intended to capture the length
dependence.

\item{\vt tsfactor}\\
{\bf range:} 0.001 -- 1.0\\
This is mainly for compatibility with the Verilog-A Josephson junction
model provided with {\WRspice} in the Verilog-A examples.  This is
equivalent to the {\WRspice} {\vt dphimax} parameter, but is
normalized to $2\pi$.  If not given, it defaults to ${\vt dphimax}/2\pi$
in {\WRspice}, or 0.1 in the Verilog-A model not used in {\WRspice}. 
This is the maximum phase change allowed between internal time points. 

\item{\vt tsaccel}\\
{\bf range:} 1.0 -- 100.0\\
Time step limiting is performed relative to the Josephson frequency of
the instantaneous absolute junction voltage or the dropback voltage,
whichever is larger.  The phase change is limited by {\vt tsfactor},
thus corresponding to a maximum time step relative to the period of
the frequency corresponding to the voltage.  Note that in SFQ
circuits, where the junctions are critically damped, the junction
voltage is unlikely to exceed the dropback voltage, which is
numerically equal to the critical current times the shunt resistance
({\vt vshunt}).  This implies that the maximum time step is a fixed
value by default.

When simulating SFQ circuits, between SFQ pulses there is often
significant time where signals are quiescent and one could probably
take larger time steps, speeding simulation.  This appears true to an
extent, however one can see signs of instability if steps are too
large.

The {\vt tsaccel} parameter is the ratio of the longest time step
allowed to that allowed at the dropback voltage.  In computing the
time step, the low voltage threshold is reduced to the dropback
voltage divided by {\vt tsaccel}, so time steps will be inversely
proportional to voltages above this value.

Experimentation suggests that a value of 2.5 is a good choice for RSFQ
circuits, your results may vary.

\item{\vt del1}, {\vt del2} (read only)\\
These two read-only parameters return the gap potential in the
electrodes.  These are computed internally as a function of
temperature.

\item{\vt vg} or {\vt vgap} (read only)\\
The junction gap voltage, equal to {\vt del1 + del2}.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{TJM Model Temperature Dependence}
\label{tjmtcf}

When the junction is not operating at the nominal temperature as
specified with the {\vt tnom} parameter, a correction factor is
applied to the critical current to account for the temperature
difference.  The superconducting energy gap and therefor the junction
gap voltage will also change as a function of temperature.

In the TJM model, the energy gaps are always computed from the BCS
integral equation involving superconducting transition temperature,
Debye temperature, and operating temperature.  The materials may be
different on the two sides of the barrier.  The junction gap voltage
is the sum of the gap potentials of the two materials.

The critical current temperature variation again follows BCS theory. 
The temperature correction factor {\it tcf} multiplies the instance
critical current to account for the temperature difference between
operating and nominal temperatures.

\begin{quote}
$tcf = (Vg/Vg_{nom})(tanh(eVg/4KT)/tanh(eVg_{nom}/4KT_{nom}))$
\end{quote}

Here, $Vg$ is the computed gap voltage, $e$ is the electron charge,
$K$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin,
