 *   currents in semiconductors and the "thermal" noise associated with
 *   resistance.  Although semiconductors also display "flicker" (1/f)
 *   noise, the lack of a unified model requires us to handle it on a
 *   "case by case" basis.  What we CAN provide, though, is the noise
 *   gain associated with the 1/f source.
