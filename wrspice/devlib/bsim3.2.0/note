I downloaded the Bsim3v2 tar distribution.  In the course of adapting
the model to WRspice (www.srware.com) I came across a few minor
things.

1) in b3ld.c line 2326:
                      if (FABS(cbhat - Ibtot)) > tol)
has a syntax error.  This shows up if NEWCONV is not set.

2) in b3temp.c line 819:
	      here->BSIM3cgso = pParam->BSIM3cgso;
	      here->BSIM3cgdo = pParam->BSIM3cgdo;
pParam is out of initialization scope.  Although it looks like pParam
won't be used before set, it appears possible that the pointer can be
to the wrong object.
It seems that that "pParam" should be "here->pParam" (?).

Minor points:
 * there are a number of variables defined but not used in b3ld.c, and
   eslewhere, plus other minor things from "gcc -Wall".
 * it would be nice if the files were de-tabbed before release.

Overall, this is a great piece of work.  Thanks for your efforts.
