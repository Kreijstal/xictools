These are the tests from the bsimsoi-4.4 distribution, in 4-node and
5-node forms.  Note that results are a bit different in the two cases,
as in the 4-node form the bulk node is floating, and it is grounded in
the 5-node form.  The r.sp is a simplified hack for checking transient
analysis without waiting for the whole ring oscillator to simulate.
