This is bsimsoi-4.4 from Berkeley:
    http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsimsoi

The PORT_CONNECTED macro has been turned on, since WRspice supports
$port_connected and optional ports.

This is a "reference" model, and should provide complete functionality
and results equivalent to the built-in bsimsoi-4.4 model compiled from
C code.

Complete CMC QA results are available for this model and the
C-language version.  Agreement is excellent.

A pre-built module is available in the "module_dist" directory.

To build:

0.  Make sure that the admst-2.3.0-wr package is installed on your
system.  This is available from the free software area of wrcad.com. 
The package has important improvements and bug fixes, and is required
for building modules for WRspice.  Use of another adms distribution
will cause trouble.

1.  If you are reading this from the WRspice installation area, copy
this directory to a personal work area, and work from there.  Below,
"this directory" implies the copied directory (with its files and
any sub-directories).

2.  The Makefile has been provided.  Have a look at the top part of
the file where the configuration variables are set, and read the
comments.  Make any desired changes.

3.  Type "make".  This will create and compile the C++ files, eventually
producing the loadable module named "bsoi44.so" ("bsoi44.dylib" in OS X).

4.  Use the devload command or -m command-line option in WRspice to
load the module.  You will then be able to run the examples.
