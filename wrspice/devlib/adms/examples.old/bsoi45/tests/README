The .wrs files were created for WRspice.  The modelcard files were also
modified for WRspice for illustration, to provide the level value, but
this is not required.

The Hspice (.sp) files don't work in WRspice, primarily due to the
device call with key letter 'x' instead of 'm'.

The ring_osc example dies with timestep too small.

Other files give results, some with parameter range warnings.

Instructions:

Start WRspice in interactive mode.

Use the devload command (or similar) to load the bsoi45 module.

Run the .wrs files - they run automatically when sourced.
