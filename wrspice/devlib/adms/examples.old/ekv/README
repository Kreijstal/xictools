This is the EKV-2.6 MOS model Verilog-A code, as distributed with
ngspice-23.  Documentation and newer versions may be available from
the EKV developers at Ecole Polytechnique (http://ekv.epfl.ch).

This should be equivalent to the EKV-2.6 model built into WRspice,
which is provided as C-code.  This has not been tested.

This model is not recommended, as apparently there is no availability
of model source code, test circuits, or QA data without begging from
the authors.

A pre-built module is available in the "module_dist" directory.

To build:

0.  Make sure that the admst-2.3.0-wr package is installed on your
system.  This is available from the free software area of wrcad.com. 
The package has important improvements and bug fixes, and is required
for building modules for WRspice.  Use of another adms distribution
will cause trouble.

1.  If you are reading this from the WRspice installation area, copy
this directory to a personal work area, and work from there.  Below,
"this directory" implies the copied directory (with its files and
any sub-directories).

2.  The Makefile has been provided.  Have a look at the top part of
the file where the configuration variables are set, and read the
comments.  Make any desired changes.

3.  Type "make".  This will create and compile the C++ files, eventually
producing the loadable module named "ekv.so" ("ekv.dylib" in OS X).

4.  Use the devload command or -m command-line option in WRspice to
load the module.  You will then be able to run the examples.
