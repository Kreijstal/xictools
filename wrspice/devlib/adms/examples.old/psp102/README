This is the PSP102 MOS model Verilog-A code.  Documentation and newer
versions may be available from the developers at NXP
(http://www.nxp.com/models/mos-models/model-psp.html) or Arizona State
University (http://pspmodel.asu.edu).

Verilog-A code changes, search for "XXX":
In Common102_macrodefs.include, added a "insideADMS" conditional to
define the P() macro.  This is needed to specify the instance
parameters.  Everything was nicely set up, just had to turn it on!

Full QA data are available in the separate QA download file.  WRspice
agreement with QA data is outstanding.

A pre-built module is available in the "module_dist" directory.

To build:

0.  Make sure that the admst-2.3.0-wr package is installed on your
system.  This is available from the free software area of wrcad.com. 
The package has important improvements and bug fixes, and is required
for building modules for WRspice.  Use of another adms distribution
will cause trouble.

1.  If you are reading this from the WRspice installation area, copy
this directory to a personal work area, and work from there.  Below,
"this directory" implies the copied directory (with its files and
any sub-directories).

2.  The Makefile has been provided.  Have a look at the top part of
the file where the configuration variables are set, and read the
comments.  Make any desired changes.

3.  Type "make".  This will create and compile the C++ files, eventually
producing the loadable module named "psp102.so" ("psp102.dylib" in OS X).

Note: there are several variations of the psp102 model which can be
built.

4.  Use the devload command or -m command-line option in WRspice to
load the module.  You will then be able to run the examples.
