This is the HICUM2 BJT model Verilog-A code.  Documentation and newer
versions may be available from the developers at TU Dresden
(http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/iee/eb/hic_new/hic_intro.html).

Unlike the hicum0 model, this along with QA data are available
directly via download from the developer's web site.

Beware that his model generates floating-point exceptions, requiring
the use of ".options fpemode=1" in many circuits.  One can also
undefine CALC_OP in the source file, which avoids executing the block
where the problems occur, but prevents calculation of internal data
for export.

Complete QA results are available for this model in the separate QA
download.

A pre-built module is available in the "module_dist" directory.

To build:

0.  Make sure that the admst-2.3.0-wr package is installed on your
system.  This is available from the free software area of wrcad.com. 
The package has important improvements and bug fixes, and is required
for building modules for WRspice.  Use of another adms distribution
will cause trouble.

1.  If you are reading this from the WRspice installation area, copy
this directory to a personal work area, and work from there.  Below,
"this directory" implies the copied directory (with its files and
any sub-directories).

2.  The Makefile has been provided.  Have a look at the top part of
the file where the configuration variables are set, and read the
comments.  Make any desired changes.

3.  Type "make".  This will create and compile the C++ files, eventually
producing the loadable module named "hicum2.so" ("hicum0.dylib" in OS X).

4.  Use the devload command or -m command-line option in WRspice to
load the module.  You will then be able to run the examples.
