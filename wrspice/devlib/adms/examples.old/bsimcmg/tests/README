The .sp files are for HSPICE only, the .wrs files are the WRspice
equivalents, created by Whiteley Research Inc.

The Hspice (.sp) files don't work in WRspice, mostly due to the use of
'x' as the device key letter.

It is worth studying the .control lines in the .wrs files.  Use is
made of new featrues introduced in wrspice-4.1.7 that facilitate
loading of data from the Hspice results (.lis files) for direct
comparison.  The Hspice results are included in all generated output
from the .wrs files.  One can see that WRspice and Hspice results
match very well, except for computed derivatives where Hspice does a
surprisingly poor job.

Instructions:

Start WRspice in interactive mode.

Use the devload command (or similar) to load the bsimcmg module.

Run the .wrs files - they run automatically when sourced.
