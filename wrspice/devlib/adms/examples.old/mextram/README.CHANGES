There were two changes made, search for "XXX".

1.  In parameters.inc, added back the "exclude 0" which had been
removed via an "insideADMS" define.

2.  In tscaling.inc, added back the ability to set temperature to
other than the reference value, which had been removed with a
"insideADMS" define.

Note to model developers:
Please use "insideADMS" to turn on ADMS extensions ONLY.
