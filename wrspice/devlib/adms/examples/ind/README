This is a simple linear inductor model.  For technical reasons,
inductor-type "branch" devices were not supported in the original ADMS
scripts.  Support has been added for linear inductors.  There may be
issues with inductors that have dependency on terminal voltages as
branch derivatives are not yet handled in the Jacobian framework in
the scripts.  However, nonlinear inductors with dependence only on the
branch current should be ok.
