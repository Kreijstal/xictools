The xxx.wrs files were added by Whiteley Research Inc.  for WRspice. 
The modelcard files were also modified illustrativelty for WRspice,
just the header and not the parameters, and this is not required.  We
assume here that bsim6 is level=80 in WRspice.

The Hspice (.sp) files don't work in WRspice, mostly due to the use of
'x' as the device key letter.

Instructions:

Start WRspice in interactive mode.

Use the devload command (or similar) to load the bsim6 module.

Run the .wrs files - they run automatically when sourced.
