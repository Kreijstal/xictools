This is the open-source tunnel junction model evaluator Verilog-A code,
developed by Steve Whiteley, borrowing from the mitmojco project
(https://github.com/drgulevich/mitmojco).  Actual device models are
created with thr mmjco utility provided with WRspice.

It duplicates the functionality of the internal JJ level=2 model in WRspice.
