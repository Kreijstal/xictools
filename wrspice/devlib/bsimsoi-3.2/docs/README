Dear BSIMSOI Users:

We are releasing our BSIMSOI3.2 model today. In this version, several new
features are included:

1. The model selector, SoiMod, now is both an instance and model
parameter. SoiMod will determine the operation of BSIMSOI. SoiMod=0 is for
PD device, SoiMod=2 is for ideal FD device; SoiMod=1 is for FD device with
floating body; as SoiMod=3, the model will select the operation mode for
users.

2. Model parameter TOXM is introduced to take into account TOX dependence 
in model parameters K1 and K2 hence to improve the scalability of Vth model 
over Tox.

3. Model parameter NOFF is introduced to improve moderate inversion 
transcapacitance model accuracy. These two parameter enhancements are compatible
to BSIM3/4.

4. Improved flicker noise model and thermal noise model compatible with
BSIM4 have been implemented. Gate tunneling induced shot noise and
thermal noise due to gate electrode resistance are also included.

The BSIMSOI3.2 source code, user's manual, and bug report can be
downloaded at http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsimsoi

Thank you for your support of the BSIMSOI model. We'll continue to
research new refinements to the existing model to support the progress of
the SOI CMOS technology.


Sincerely,
BSIM Team
