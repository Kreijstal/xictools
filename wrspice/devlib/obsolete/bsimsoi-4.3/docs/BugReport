Dear BSIMSOI development team,

In the course of experimenting with the bsimsoi-4.3 model, I have
discovered a couple of issues, one in the Spice3f5 code, and one in
the bsimsoi-4.x code.

Issue 1:  Convergence testing result ignored in Spice3.

I describe this here only as background to the SOI model issue.

In Spice3f5, at least my release has the NEWCONV preprocessor symbol
defined, which causes Spice3 to call all of the device-specific
convergence test functions as part of convergence testing.  This is
indeed done (adding to overhead) however the result is lost.

The device-specific convergence test functions, when a fail is
detected, will increment the CKTnoncon variable and return OK (zero).

 if (convergence_error_detected) {
     ckt->CKTnoncon++;
     return (OK);
  }

However, the caller assumes that the return value is an error count or
flag (in niconv.c):

  ckt->CKTnoncon = NIconvTest(ckt)

The ckt->CKTnoncon parameter is therefor assigned 0, whether or not
non-convergence was detected in a device.

One can fix this in niconv.c:

#ifdef NEWCONV
 
/* SRW XXX bug fixed here:  CKTconvTest always returns 0, increments
   CKTnoncon if non-vonvergence.

    i = CKTconvTest(ckt);
    if (i)
        ckt->CKTtroubleNode = 0;
    return(i);
*/
    CKTconvTest(ckt);
    ckt->CKTtroubleNode = 0;
    return(ckt->CKTnoncon);
                    
#else /* NEWCONV */
    return(0);
#endif /* NEWCONV */

This restores the intended program logic, but may reveal previously
hidden issues with the device models.

Issue 2:  BSIMSOI 4.x poor convergence.

With the change above, the bsimsoi-4.x models become far less robust
for transient analysis.  Very simple circuits, such as inv_tr.sp in
the benchmarks, require tens of thousands of iterations, or terminate
with a "timestep too small" message.

There are several ways to at least superficially "fix" the problem.  I
would appreciate any guidance on this.

1.  Undefine the global NEWCONV in Spice3f5.  This would affect all
    devices.

2.  Define NOBYPASS in the b4soild.c file.

    One observation is that the convergence test fails even when
    bypassing.  Disabling bypassing seems to solve the convergence
    issue, but of course one loses the speed-up.

    One can do this in Spice3 with "set bypass=0", bypassing is on
    by default.  Here's some comparative rusage output for two runs
    of the inv_tr.sp benchmark:

    (bypassing enabled, default condition)
    Total iterations = 25224
    Transient iterations = 25207
    Circuit Equations = 10
    Transient timepoints = 5959
    Accepted timepoints = 4486
    Rejected timepoints = 1473
    Total Analysis Time = 0.347891

    (bypassing disabled via "set bypass=0")
    Total iterations = 253
    Transient iterations = 236
    Circuit Equations = 10
    Transient timepoints = 83
    Accepted timepoints = 79
    Rejected timepoints = 4
    Total Analysis Time = 0.013455

3.  Comment out the second (cbhat) test in b4soicvtest.c.

    This is the test that is causing trouble.  Is this equation
    correct?  Maybe there should be another corresponding constraint
    added to the bypass test code in b4soild.c?

4.  Modify b4soicvtest.c to just return without testing, and locally
    undefine NEWCONV in b4soild.c.

Perhaps this can be addressed in the next release, or if there is a
recommended way to resolve this, I would appreciate seeing it.

Thanks for your great work with the bsim/bsimsoi models over the years.
