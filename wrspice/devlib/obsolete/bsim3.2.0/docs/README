Dear BSIM3 users,

Thank you for your support of BSIM3. We are releasing the BSIM3v3.2
code today.

Many enhancements to BSIM3v3.1 were requested by Compact Model Council
(CMC) (www.eia.org/eig/CMC) or proposed by UCB BSIM team and discussed
at 9/97 and 12/97 CMC meetings. BSIM3v3.2 was developed to incorporate
these enhancements. The beta code of BSIM3v3.2 was sent to the CMC
member companies on Feb. 20, 1998. The test results were discussed at
5/98 CMC meeting and via email. BSIM3v3.2 final release incorporated
those changes and bug fixes as requested from the 5/98 CMC meeting.
 
BSIM3v3.2 has the following enhancements and improvements relative
to BSIM3v3.1:

  (1)  An original and accurate charge thickness capacitance model 
       considering the finite charge layer thickness (quantum effects).
       This model is smooth, continuous and very accurate through all 
       regions of operations.

  (2)  Improved modeling of C-V characteristics at the weak to strong
       inversion transition.

  (3)  Adding the Tox dependence into the threshold voltage (Vth) model.

  (4)  Adding the flat-band voltage (Vfb) as a new model parameter.

  (5)  Improved substrate current scalability with channel length.

  (6)  Restructuring of the non-quasi-static (NQS) model, addition of
       NQS into the pole-zero analysis and fixing bugs in NQS codes.

  (7)  Adding temperature dependence into the diode junction capacitance.

  (8)  DC diode model now supporting a resistance-free diode and current-
       limiting feature.

  (9)  Option of using the inversion charge of capMod 0, 1, 2 or 3 to 
       evaluate the BSIM3 thermal noise.

  (10) Elimination of the small negative capacitance of Cgs and Cgd in 
       the accumulation-depletion regions.

  (11) Introducing a separate set of channel-width and length dependence
       parameters (Llc, Lwc, Lwlc, Wlc, Wwc and Wwlc) to calculate Weff 
       and Leff for the C-V model for better fitting of the capacitance data.

  (12) Adding parameter checking to avoid bad values for certain parameters.

  (13) Bug fixes.


Since the release of BSIM3v3.1 in Dec. 1996 , we have received a lot of
feedback and input from many users. We would like to thank Keith Green,
Tom Vrotsos, Britt Brooks and Doug Weiser at TI, Min-Chie Jeng at Cadence,
Joe Watts and Cal Bittner at IBM, Bob Daniels and Wenliang Zhang at Avant!,
David Newmark and Bhaskar Gadepally at Motorola, Zhihong Liu and Chune-Sin
Yeh at BTA, Paul Humphries and Seamus Power at Analog Devices, Mishel
Matloubian and Sally Liu at Rockwell, Bernd Lemaitre at Siemens, Ping-Chin
Yeh and Dick Dowell at HP, Shiuh-Wuu Lee, Santanu Chaudhuri and Ling-Chu 
Chien at Intel, Larry Yu and Judy An at AMD, Peter Lee at Hitachi, Toshiyuki
Saito at NEC, Richard Taylor at NSC and Patti Rusher at EIA for their 
valuable comments and suggestions. We have considered all the comments 
carefully and acted on nearly all of them in the development of BSIM3v3.2.

I want to give special acknowledgements to Dr. Keeth Green, Chairman of the 
Technical Issue Subcommittee of CMC; Britt Brooks, chair of CMC, and Bhaskar 
Gadepally, former co-chair of CMC, and Dr. Min-Chie Jeng for their guidance and
support. Dr. Weidong Liu was the principal developer of BSIM3v3.2; graduate 
student Xiaodong Jin was co-developer. Graduate student Yachin King provided 
the quantum mechanic analysis basis for the innovative charge thickness 
capacitance model, which is a significant step forward from the charge sheet 
model. Graduate student James Chen built and maintained the attractive BSIM3
web site. BSIM3 research is partially supported by SRC, CMC and Rockwell.

BSIM3v3.2 source code can be downloaded from the BSIM3 web site 
(www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bsim3). A detailed description of the difference 
between BSIM3v3.2 and BSIM3v3.1 can also be found there. The user manual and 
standard test results will be available in July. Your feedback is always
welcome and may be sent to Dr. Weidong Liu (liuwd@fermi.eecs.berkeley.edu).

Sincerely,

Chenming Hu         June 16, 1998
