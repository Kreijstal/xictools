Dear BSIM Users,

Thank you very much for your support of the BSIM models. We 
would like to announce that two bugs in the thermal noise 
model and the flicker noise model have been fixed in BSIM3. 
The new release is BSIM3v3.2.4. 

With these two fixes, the Rds noise is now included in the 
thermal noise model. Unified flicker noise is smoothed out 
from the linear region to saturation region. These two bug 
fixes were first introduced in BSIM4.0.0 and have been 
thoroughly tested. The flicker noise bug fix will likely 
necessitate re-extraction of the parameters for the unified 
flicker noise model. 

Detailed bugs and their fixes, the BSIM3v3.2.4 source code, 
and the technical note can be downloaded at:

We welcome your feedback.

Sincerely,

Jane
