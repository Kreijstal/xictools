Dear Sirs,

I am testing your HiSIM1.1.0 model in WRspice (www.wrcad.com) and hope
to eventually provide it to users in a future release.  This looks
like a very useful model and you should be commended for your efforts.

WRspice is a C++ program, and the process of importing a new model
involves converting the various spice3 functions into methods of a
class for the new device.  This is fairly straightforward but there is
always a possibility of error.  The first problem I encountered was
that I could not find any simple test circuits for the model.  It
would be very useful if you could provide on your download site some
simple example spice files along with print output, so that users can
test their model installation and make sure that the results are
correct.  If you know of a source of test spice files for hisim, I
would appreciate knowing the location.

I found that I was able to run several tests by using the default
model parameters, i.e., giving no model parameters other than level=60
and version=110/100.

When running a very simple circuit containing one MOS device, the
first time the circuit is run, it failed with the message

   "*** warning(HiSIM): FP-exception (PART-1)"

This happened for any type of analysis, and only on the first run. 
Subsequent runs seem to work ok.  It would also run ok on the
first try if version=110 was given, i.e., this seems to be specific
to 1.0.0.  I traced the problem as follows:

The problem originates in the hsm1eval1_0.c file.

The variable FMD_dVds defined on line 498 is uninitialized.

This variable would be initialized on line 2634, however for the
parameters given, this block is skipped due to the branch taken at
line 2560.

At line 3113, FMD_dVds is used in the assignment to rp1_dVds.

At line 3125, rp1_dVds is used in the assignment to Ids_dVds.

At line 3915, Ids_dVds is assigned to Ids_dVdse.

At line 4322, Ids_dVdse is assigned to pOT->gds;

At line 4482, pOT->gds is used in the assignment to T1.

T1 fails the test at line 4484.

Apparently, what is happening is that on the first run, the
unitialized value of FMD_dVds happens to be NaN, which propogates
through the other assignments causing the failure at line 4484.  In
subsequent runs, the value is apparently something other than NaN. 
The assigment in line 3113

    rp1_dVds = FMD_dVds * sIN.rpock1 ;

succeeds (sIN.rpock1 = 0), and everything is correct.

I fixed the problem by adding a block that initializes all of the
variables the are mentioned in gcc "used before set" warnings to zero,
which is probably overkill.

Another thing I noticed is that some more complicated files would fail
in transient analysis with a "timestep too small" error.  Perhaps this
would go away if I used different model parameters.  I traced this
problem to the situation where two MOS devices are in series (source
to drain).  In this situation, the voltage on the source/drain node is
not well defined, and does not converge in the analysis.  I found that
adding a small capacitance of 1fF to the circuit file, between this
node and ground, most often fixed the problem.  The same circuit
simulates without modification with bsim3/4 and other models, so
perhaps some modification can be made to hisim to make it less
susceptible to this problem.  An example of a file that shows this
effect (at least in WRspice) is below.


Thanks for your efforts.  The model obviously represents a lot of hard
work.
