The tar file distribution contains the bsimsoi device code which should
go into the directory "src/lib/dev/b3soi" of the SPICE engine.  The
other four files "inpdomod.c","inp2m.c","cktbindn.c" and "gendefs.h" 
should replace the files with the same name in "src/lib/inp" and in
"src/lib/ckt" and "src/include" respctively.  
"inpdomod.c" adds level9 to SPICE (which is the level BSIM3SOI uses) and 
"inp2m.c", "cktbindn.c" and "gendefs.h" changes the way SPICE parses lines 
beginning with "m" so that they can handle the optional body node.



To decode the tared code file, enter UNIX operating system and go to the 
directory containing the tared file, then type commands as following:

             > uncompress BSIMPD2p1.tar
             > tar -xvf BSIMPD2p1.tar



To decode the tared manual file, put (or use FTP) the downloaded manual tared
file into a directory of UNIX and go to the directory containing the tared 
file, then type commands as following:

             > mv bsimpd_man2p1_ps_tar.Z bsimpd_man2p1.ps.tar.Z
             > uncompress bsimpd_man2p1.ps.tar
             > tar -xvf bsimpd_man2p1.ps.tar

To print the manual to postscript printer, invoke:

             > lpr bsimpd_man2p1.ps
or

             > lpr -P <printer_name> bsimpd_man2p1.ps
