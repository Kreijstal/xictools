This directory contains the source distributions for the LEF and DEF
toolkits, and documentation, as obtained from the Si2 organization. 
These are redistributed here under the terms of the covering
Apache-2.0 license.

The lef_5.8-p013.tar.gz file differs from the original lef_5.8-p013.tar.Z
only by having the Microsoft line terminations removed from lef/crypt.cpp,
and gzip rather than Z compression. 

The patch files are applied before use in the router.  The most
important change is to compile files with -fPIC, so that they can be
used in a shared library.  There are other tweaks, such as support for
Apple OS X and syntax updates for Bison-3.  View the files for more
info.
