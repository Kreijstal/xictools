The scripts are run differently in dpkg than rpm, here's the order and
what they do here.

prerm
    (run if old install found)
    Remove xic link, xic wrapper script and links in xictools/bin.
    Move xic.current to xic-version for Safe Install.

preinst
    Remove xic link, xic wrapper script and links in xictools/bin.
    These should already be gone.

(unpack new files)

postrm
    (run if old install found)
    Nothing to do.

postinst
    Link technology file xic_tech.scmos to xic_tech.
    Link xic.current to xic.
    Create xictools/bin if necessary.
    Copy in through sed the xic wrapper script.
    Create the links in xictools/bin.
