-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the central list of things to address in Xic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Half-baked things below.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

todo:  implement same-net DRC tests.

TODO: make instance labels moveable by user in ext setup?

TODO add property to prevent merging?

TODO (maybe)
Allow "9 1 library ....", will open library b4 read

XXX Bug: "+" icon current fails for caps with .param value.

TODO:
add hash table script functions.
add an InstanceCount() script func that returns a hash table handle..
TODO: script interface to Lisp parser.

todo (maybe): handle all-angle GDSII cell placements.
gds reader would add a property to instances giving real angle.
bottom-up traversal would reparent these instances into an ortho cell with
rotated content.

Idea:
Somehow maybe make the spin operation applicable whever objects are
being placed/moved/copied?

Idea: string table, hash tab elements are kept in one big array.  Each
string is associated with an int offset into the array.  Decorate this
int with a struct with a type conversion operator to const char*, which
returns the string.  I.e., CDname is an int instead of a char* saves space
in 64-bit binaries.  Do this for other hashable objects?
todo: write a template class implementing this.

todo: report bad objects in info somehow.
fix: long text incs mod count at wrong time.

todo: make Push/Pop and Info work better with cell arrays.

todo: implement net extraction with bloat from netex file.
add vias

TODO: use hash tables in dsp_marks.cc

Long term ------
TODO: look at more complete SPICE file extraction - for exjjiv.cir for
example (.model lines retained?)
TODO: extend spice parsing to support .param, .if/.else/.endif and perhaps
model binning

Subject: Import from Spice questions
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.2070.6)
 
Hi Steve,
 
I’ve started digging into the electrical mode of Xic and I’m very impressed. The
+ability to (almost) seamlessly transition between an electrical model and
+physical layout is a feature I’ve never seen implemented very well in other
+layout programs. I do however have a question about how Xic handles importing a
+SPICE .cir file. The problem is that I’ve noticed that Xic doesn’t seem to
+correctly import voltage/current controlled switches/sources from a
+pre-existing SPICE model. For instance if my pre-existing spice file contains a
+voltage controlled voltage source like:
 
ed n6 n4 n21 0 (abs(V(n21)+V(n21))/2)*i(Ld)/2
 
if I import my model into Xic via Source SPICE and then export via the dump
+SPICE button I get back:
 
ed n6 n4 abs(V(n21)+V(n21))/2)*i(Ld)/2
 
This has two errors, the first is that the controlling nodes are missing which
+prevents my model from running in Xic, the second is that the leading
+parenthesis is missing creating a syntax error if the result of the dumped
+SPICE file is run with WRSpice. The same error seems to occur for all
+current/voltage controlled devices, e, f, g, w ect. A second error I noticed is
+that definitions of a model in a pre-existing SPICE file are ignored. For
+instance if in my SPICE model I have :
 
.subckt XXXX pg ps pd
.
.


wsreset2 n62 0 l3 Iswitch

.model Iswitch CSW(it=0.2u ron=1e6 roff=0.0001)
 
.ends XXXX
 

I get back after sourcing and dumping :


.
.
.

wsreset2 n62 0 Iswitch_nTron

So the switch has lost its control variable and the model definition has
+disappeared.

Thanks again for all your help. Let me know if there is a solution/work around
+or anything I can do on my end to help.
 

Cheers,

Andrew

Hi Steve,
 
Thanks for the script you sent, I took a look at some of the examples and was
happy to see that Xic supports a power scripting language, but there are some
features that are nice to have at your fingertips. Since you're working on a
new version of Xic, I might make a few suggestions:
 
1. The ability to have the cursor snap to underlaying geometry, especially the
end points of a ruler, was a feature I found very useful in other packages.
This really helped me double check critical dimensions of my designs before I
sent them out for production.
>>> DONE

2.  I really like the bang (!) and keyboard accelerator commands for drawing and
manipulating objects but they're a little disjointed. For instance ro draws a
circle but !ro rotates an object. You might consider eliminating ro in favor of
!circ where !circ with no args allows a free form circle to be drawn but !circ
x,y,r draws a circle at x,y with radius r.
>>> Changed the name !ro to !spin.  The ro accelerator is a good enough
!circ command.
 
I look forward to using the latest and greats Xic release.
 
Cheers,

Hi Stephen,
 
I've started playing around with Xic more seriously and have noticed a few
+things that are a little off with this install/version of Xic.
 
1. Zoom function keys don't all work. Numeric +,- don't work to zoom out, in.
fn-return, fn-right arrow seem ok as does control-scroll wheel. I have also
noticed that Xic doesn't recognize the fn key when pressed from the Kinesis
Freestyle 2 keyboard (Mac Version). The function key is recognized by the rest
of the OS but Xic doesn't understand it. I have to use the built in keyboard on
the Macbook for the fn key to work properly in Xic. That last part isn't
necessarily your problem just that some third party keyboards seem to cause
difficulties.
 
2. X windows seems to get very confused when I use multiple displays. The Help
menu for instance doesn't translate over properly when I use my Macbook in
conjunction with my Apple display. This is really Apples problem but I just
wanted to let you know.
 
3. Alt-char accelerators for the menu options don't seem to work.
 
Thanks again for your help. Since there are multiple ways to do things in Xic
none of the issues above is really that big a deal, I just have to figure out
by trial an error what the best way to do something is.
 
Cheers,
 
Andrew

Hi Stephen,

Thanks as always for your help. I’m a big fan of the changes you made, the
+windows now appear correctly when I use two displays and the ruler
+functionality with snapping to non-manhattan objects is much improved. I’ve
+played around a little more and do have a few more suggestions to add to the
+next release.

1. Selecting Layer visibility does not force the screen to redraw. I’ve noticed
+that when I toggle the visibility of a layer I need to do something (like move
+left/right or zoom in/out) to force the screen to refresh so the visibility
+option takes effect. This is a little obnoxious if you want to quickly see the
+different layers of your circuit.

2. I really like the new Grid Setup options but you’re missing the option to
+select if the cursor snaps to the grid or not. For instance its sometimes
+useful to free hand draw a shape not anchored to the grid. Perhaps this ability
+is implemented some other way.

3. Usage of the right mouse button (button 3) to center and zoom is a little
+confusing. Two clicks of the right mouse selecting an area zooms that region to
+fill the current window, but a click-drag-release just centers the selected
+region. This took me a little while to get the hang of since a
+click-drag-release to zoom into the selected region is in general faster that
+the two click method.

Thanks again for being so responsive. I’m sure I’ll have more suggestions as I
+move into using the more powerful features of Xic

Cheers,

Andrew

Hi Steve,

I’ve started playing around with cell arrays and hierarchy and have run into a
+few problems. Attached is a screen shot to show you where I’ve gotten.

1. I like that its easy to create a new cell out of an object(s) in your current
+cell, essentially its easy to build your layout descending in hierarchy.
+Unfortunately the opposite doesn’t seem to be true. It seems very difficult to
+create a new, blank cell and populate it with an array(s) or previously
+existing cells. The work around I found was to copy an existing cell, delete
+its contents and then place cell arrays inside that. It would be great if the
+Create Cell command would create a new blank cell if no objects where selected
+before entering that command. Let me know if there is a better way to do this
+that I just haven’t discovered.

2. Populating a cell with an array of cells is such a common activity that I
+think it deserves a its own quick draw feature like rectangle, circle, xor ect.
+Clicking this button would popup a dialogue box where the user would input the
+cell to create an array of and n x m dimension of the cell array. The user
+would then click once to define the coordinate of the (0,0) array element and
+once more to define the (n,m) array element. The remainder of the array would
+automatically populate in a regular grid.

3. Hierarchy visibility is confusing me. When I create an array of a particular
+cell in a new cell it appears as a bounded box with some simple information
+about the cell array printed inside. This is totally fine and in general
+useful. The problem is that I don’t know how to tell Xic, “Display everything n
+cells deep in the hierarchy tree”. So far in order to see inside the cell array
+I have to explicitly flatten the cell. It would be great if there was a little
+area (right above the layer visibility in the menu bar) that allowed the user
+to increment and decrement the visibility of the hierarchy in a given cell. I
+might even be so bold as to suggest that numerical +/- be dedicated to this
+feature rather than zoom since the right click combined with ctrl-scroll wheel
+is already a very quick and fluid way to zoom in/out of a region of interest.


Thanks again for all your help.

Cheers,

Andrew

Subject: WRSpice modules
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.2070.6)

Hi Stephen,
 
Thanks very much for your most recent updates to Xic and WRSpice, the mkscript
+feature is great and the fixes to the current controlled sources have my model
+up and running. As I dig into my project however I’m finding the need to use
+ever more powerful features of your programs, which brings me to a few
+questions about building and implementing my own modules in WRSpice.
 
1. Do you have (or can you point me to) some documentation on the C++ API for
+WRSpice? I ask since I’m pretty proficient with C,C++ but new to Verilog and in
+some cases it will be easier for me to just write a module directly in C++
+rather than write it in Verilog, and translate via ADMS. This is especially
+true for devices with complicated physics behind them. Furthermore as you point
+out, ADMS doesn’t work perfectly and being able to confidently tweak the C code
+to get the behavior I want will be critical.
2. Is it possible to include new modules into the Xic electrical layout as a new
+symbol that can be “plugged into” a circuit design. I suspect there is since I
+can see you define symbols explicitly in device.lib files but the syntax for
+drawing the symbol and  associating them with a particular model/module is a
+little hard to parse. A tutorial would be greatly appreciated here.
 
Thanks once again for your help.
 
Cheers,
 
Andrew

Hi Stephen,
 
I’m trying to develop a new WRSpice module from an existing Verilog model and am
+running into a few problems. I’ve successfully compiled and tested your
+examples and have even read the Implementation guide and Adding devices to
+SPICE3 chapters from Thomas Quarles’ Thesis so I have some idea whats going on
+“under the hood”. The module I’m trying to compile is a memristor (resistance
+depends on last input above some threshold) with a switching mechanism that is
+sensitive to thermal noise, see attached Verilog code. This is modeled in the
+Verilog as gaussian random numbers thrown before the impedance is calculated.
+The problem this causes is that ADMS has no support for random number
+generation as defined in Verilog. See error below:
 
[fatal..] ./STT-PMTJ.va:2642:10: analog function '$rdist_normal' is undefined
[fatal..] see [/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/devkit/admst/adms.implicit.xml:750]
make: *** [STT_PMTJdefs.h] Error 1
 
Do you have any plans (or spare time) to implement a translation of $random
+functions in Verilog to the <random> functions implemented in C via ADMS? If
+not I’ve started doing a little digging into ADMS and might be able to hack
+something myself. Its a pity that we’re starting to fork pretty far from the
+project on GitHub but se la vie.

In an effort to push forward, I commented out the $rdist functions and fixed the
+noise contributions to 0. Now I got a little further but ran into the
+following:

STT_PMTJload.cc:491:57: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('double'
+and 'double')
Fair enough c compiler, it is wrong to use % with doubles. Actually this points
+to a bug in ADMS, I would need to investigate what behavior was causing the
+need to mod by 2pi in the C code, but ADMS should use either fmod or remainder
+in this case. Perhaps also a consistent more precise value of pi. After
+replacing with
 
V2 = fmod(ckt->va_idt(inst->STATE_idt_12,I2,0.0),2*3.1415);
 
the dylib compiles successfully modulo a few warnings about unused variables.
+I’ll see how things work once I start playing with this thing in WRSpice and
+I’m sure I’ll have more questions related to optimizing/debugging my model.
+Thanks again for all your help.

Cheers,
 
Andrew
