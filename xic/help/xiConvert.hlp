    In addition to the native cell-per-file format, <b>Xic</b> has
    interoperability with a number of <a href="xic:fsaf">archive
    formats</a>.  These file types can be read into <i>Xic</i>
    directly with the <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command, and
    generated with the <a href="xic:save"><b>Save As</b></a> command. 
    The <b>Convert Menu</b> provides for setting format-specific
    conversion parameters, and contains other conversion commands.

    <p>
    Under 32-bit Unix/Linux, files are opened in 64-bit offset mode. 
    This enables files larger than 2Gb to be processed.

    <p>
    Native <i>Xic</i> cells use a CIF-like ASCII format, with one cell
    per file.  This is the default format used by <i>Xic</i>, but is
    not particularly efficient with respect to input/output speed and
    disk space.

    <h2>Supported Archive File Formats</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
    In addition to the native cell-per-file format, <i>Xic</i> supports
    a number of archive formats, which can contain one or more cell
    descriptions.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>GDSII</b><dd>
    The <b>GDSII</b> (Stream) format is an industry-standard binary
    file format for cell hierarchies and libraries.  <i>Xic</i> can
    read Format Release 3-7 files, and write either Format Release 7
    or Format Release 3 (which is readable on systems supporting
    Format Release 3-7).  GDSII files that have been compressed with
    the GNU <tt>gzip</tt> program or equivalent can be read directly,
    and similarly compressed GDSII output can be generated by
    <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    The GDSII directives absolute magnification, absolute angle, and
    absolute path width are not supported in <i>Xic</i>.  If found
    in input, the values
    are taken as relative, and a warning is issued.  These are not
    supported by other file formats in a portable way, and should be
    considered obsolete.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CGX</b><dd>
    The <b>CGX</b> (Computer Graphics eXchange) format is a
    public-domain binary archive <a href="cgxformat">format</a>
    developed by Whiteley Research Inc.  Similar in structure to
    GDSII, the advantages are more efficient data representation for
    reduced file size and ease of parsing for faster read/write. 
    Although presently available only in Whiteley Research products,
    it is anticipated that the format will eventually be supported by
    other vendors.  CGX files that have been compressed with the GNU
    <tt>gzip</tt> program or equivalent can be read directly, and
    similarly compressed CGX output can be generated by <i>Xic</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>OASIS</b><dd>
    The Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (<b>OASIS</b>) is a
    new standard for mask layout data being developed by the SEMI
    organization.  This is a binary format which features more compact
    representation and thus smaller files than GDSII.

    <p>
    More information is available <a href="oasis">here</a> and from <a
    href="http://wrcad.com/oasis/"><tt>wrcad.com/oasis</tt></a>.

    <p>
    The present status of OASIS support in <i>Xic</i> is complete:
    <ol>
    <li><i>Xic</i> can read any spec-conforming OASIS file.
    <li>OASIS output from <i>Xic</i> is readable by any other
        spec-conforming tool.
    <li>Exceptions to the above are *bugs*, please report!
    </ol>

    <p>
    Although it is "not documented", <i>Xic</i> can directly read
    OASIS files that have been compressed with the <tt>gzip</tt>
    program or equivalent.  Unlike for GDSII files, this is not really
    supported, and it is not possible to write gzipped OASIS output
    from <i>Xic</i>.  It is preferable to use the compression provided
    in the OASIS format.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF</b><dd>
    The <b>CIF</b> format, though a bit archaic, is still popular. 
    <i>Xic</i> supports a number of selectable dialects and
    extensions.

    <p>
    If the input file is in CIF format, and symbol (cell) names are
    not provided (i.e., no symbol name extension is found), the
    generated symbol names will be "<tt>Symbol</tt><i>N</i>", where
    <i>N</i> is the integer symbol number given in the CIF file.

    <h2>Backwards Compatibility Issues</h2>
    </a>

    <font size=6 color=red>In general, files produced with this
    <i>Xic</i> release are <b>NOT</b> compatible with
    pre-<i>Xic</i>-4.0 releases.</font>

    <p>
    The native cell files and CIF now accept and generate arbitrarily
    long layer names.  These are not compatible with traditional CIF,
    or with older <i>Xic</i> releases.  Older <i>Xic</i> releases will
    fail to read native cell files, or CIF files, with non-traditional
    layer names. Traditional CIF layer names contain four characters or
    fewer.

    <p>
    Native cell files and CIF files from the 4.0 branch that use
    traditional CIF layer names should be backward compatible in this
    respect.

    <p>
    There is a new syntax used for electrical <a
    href="prpty:node"><b>node</b></a> property strings.  This will, in
    general, prevent backwards compatibility of schematic files.  If
    the <a href="Out32nodes"><b>Out32nodes</b></a> variable is set,
    files written will use the old node syntax, with loss of some data
    that is not supported by the older syntax, but files will be
    readable by older <i>Xic</i> programs.

    The <b>Convert Menu</b> entry brings up a menu containing commands
    which perform explicit translations and other manipulations and
    diagnostics.

    <p>
    The table below lists the commands found in the <b>Convert Menu</b>,
    and gives the internal name and a brief description.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">

    </table>

    <p>
    The <a href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:filemenu"><b>File Menu</b></a> can be used directly to
    read files in the supported formats for editing.  When a cell is
    written to disk, it is by default written in the format of origin,
    though a format change can be coerced in the <a
    href="xic:save"><b>Save As</b></a> command by supplying a file
    extension.  Thus, there are alternatives to using many of the
    commands in the <b>Convert Menu</b>.

    <p>
    During a conversion, a <a href="logfiles">log file</a> is written
    by the converters.  This file contains a record of messages
    emitted during the conversion.  If during a conversion an error or
    warning message is emitted, a file browsing window containing the
    log file will appear when the conversion is complete, though this
    can be suppressed by setting the <a
    href="NoPopUpLog"><b>NoPopUpLog</b></a> variable.  These
    messages also appear on the prompt line during the conversion. 
    The file browser is a read-only version of the <a
    href="texteditor">text editor</a> window, and has a number of
    associated keyboard commands, including word searching.

    <p>
    On GDSII and OASIS input, if there is no specified mapping for a
    given layer and datatype, an <a href="gdslayer">attempt is
    made</a> to map to existing <i>Xic</i> layers, and if that fails,
    a new layer is created.

    <p>
    When reading CIF, layer names are matched to those defined in the
    current technology in a case-insensitive mode.  This differs from
    native and CGX file types, which use case-sensitive matching. 
    Layers found in the file which do not match any in the technology
    are created, using default parameters.

In addition to the native cell-per-file format, {\Xic} has
interoperability with the archive file formats listed below.  These
file types can be read into {\Xic} directly with the {\cb Open}
command, and generated with the {\cb Save As} command.  The {\cb
Convert Menu} provides for setting format-specific conversion

In addition to the native cell-per-file format, {\Xic} supports a
number of archive formats, which can contain one or more cell
descriptions.

\begin{description}
\item{GDSII}\\
The GDSII (Stream) format is an industry-standard binary file format
for cell hierarchies and libraries.  {\Xic} can read Format Release
3--7 files, and write either Format Release 7 or Format Release 3
(which is readable on systems supporting Format Release 3--7).  GDSII
files that have been compressed with the GNU {\vt gzip} program or
equivalent can be read directly, and similarly compressed GDSII output
can be generated by {\Xic}.

The GDSII directives absolute magnification, absolute angle, and
absolute path width are not supported in {\Xic}.  If found in input,
the values are taken as relative, and a warning is issued.  These are
not supported by other file formats in a portable way, and should be
considered obsolete.

\item{CGX}\\
The CGX (Computer Graphics eXchange) format is a public-domain binary
archive format developed by Whiteley Research Inc.  Similar in
structure to GDSII, the advantages are more efficient data
representation for reduced file size and ease of parsing for faster
read/write.  Although presently available only in Whiteley Research

\item{OASIS}\\
The Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (OASIS) is a new standard
for mask layout data being developed by the SEMI organization.  This
is a binary format which features more compact representation and thus
smaller files than GDSII.

More information is available from {\vt wrcad.com/oasis}.

The present status of OASIS support in {\Xic} is complete:

and it is not possible to write gzipped OASIS output from {\Xic}.  It
is preferable to use the compression provided in the OASIS format.

% 111513
\item{CIF}\\
The CIF format, though a bit archaic, is still popular.  {\Xic}
supports a number of selectable dialects and extensions.

If the input file is in CIF format, and symbol (cell) names are not
provided (i.e., no symbol name extension is found), the generated
symbol names will be ``{\vt Symbol}{\it N}'', where {\it N} is the
integer symbol number given in the CIF file.
\end{description}

{\bf In general, files produced with this {\Xic} release are NOT
compatible with pre-{\Xic}-4.0 releases.}

The native cell files and CIF now accept and generate arbitrarily long
layer names.  These are not compatible with traditional CIF, or with
older {\Xic} releases.  Older {\Xic} releases will fail to read native
cell files, or CIF files, with non-traditional layer names. 
Traditional CIF layer names contain four characters or fewer.

Native cell files and CIF files from the 4.0 branch that use
traditional CIF layer names should be backward compatible in this
respect.

There is a new syntax used for electrical {\et node} property strings. 
This will, in general, prevent backwards compatibility of schematic
files.  If the {\et Out32nodes} variable is set, files written will
use the old node syntax, with loss of some data that is not supported
by the older syntax, but files will be readable by older {\Xic}
programs.

The {\cb Open} command in the {\cb File} menu can be used directly to
read files in the supported formats for editing.  When a cell is
written to disk, it is by default written in the format of origin,
though a format change can be coerced in the {\cb Save As} command by
supplying a file extension.  Thus, there are alternatives to using
many of the commands in the {\cb Convert Menu}.

During a conversion, a log file is written by the converters.  This
file contains a record of messages emitted during the conversion.  If
during a conversion an error or warning message is emitted, a file
browsing window containing the log file will appear when the
conversion is complete, though this can be suppressed by setting the
{\et NoPopUpLog} variable.  These messages also appear on the prompt
line during the conversion.  The file browser is a read-only version
of the text editor window, and has a number of associated keyboard
commands, including word searching.  See \ref{textedit} for a listing
of these commands.

On GDSII and OASIS input, if there is no specified mapping for a given
layer and datatype, an attempt is made to map to the existing {\Xic}
layers, and if that fails, a new layer is created.

When reading CIF, layer names are matched to those defined in the
current technology in a case-insensitive mode.  This differs from
native and CGX file types, which use case-sensitive matching.  Layers
found in the file which do not match any in the technology are
created, using default parameters.

Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{There are three internal global scale factor registers, which
are set in the various windows and with the {\vt SetConvertScale}
script function.  One scale (R) is for reading, another (W) is for
writing, and the third (C) is for format conversion.  This indicator
is shown in the {\kb Scaling} column.  The lower case `s' applies to
script functions that take a local scale value.}

\item{The layer filtering and aliasing module is a group of controls
that appear in the {\cb Format Conversion} panel and elsewhere.  These
maintain the values in the {\et LayerList} variable and related.  A
`Y' in the {\kb Layer Filter} column appears where layer filtering can
apply.}

\item{The {\cb Cell Name Mapping} module is a group of controls that
allow cell name aliasing, case changing, etc.  This module appears in
the {\cb Format Conversion} panel and elsewhere.  The state for this
module tracks two sets of variables, similar to {\it InToLower} and
{\it OutToLower}, depending on whether the panel is controlling input
or output.  The code letters in the {\cb Cell Name Mapping} are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
r or w & Reading or writing variables.\\
A      & The auto-aliasing feature for cell name clashes is available.\\
C      & Case conversion is available.\\
F      & Alias files can be used.\\
P      & A prefix and/or suffix can be added to cell names.\\
\end{tabular} }

\item{The {\cb Format Conversion} panel and others contain a windowing
module, containing controls for entering a rectangle, plus {\cb Use
Window}, {\cb Clip}, {\cb Flatten}, and empty cell filtering buttons. 
Internally, there are two global register sets for the state of these
controls, one for output and one for format conversion (windowing is
never used for input).  The {\vt SetConvertFlags} and {\vt
SetConvertArea} functions can also be used to set the flag states and
the windowing area.

The codes in the {\kb Windowing} column are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
c or o & Conversion or output values.\\
W      & Windowing is available.\\
C      & Clipping to the window is possible.\\
F      & Flattening is available.\\
E      & Empty cell filtering is available.\\
\end{tabular}

If flattening (F) is listed first, the other options are only
available when flattening.  The option letters are listed in lower
case for script functions that take local values as arguments.}

    Releases of <i>Xic</i> prior to 3.0.5 allowed white space in cell
    names.  However, some <i>Xic</i> features, such as selection of
    cell names in the <a href="xic:cells"><b>Cells Listing</b></a>
    panel will not work with cell names containing white space, and
    there are probably many other examples.  Most basic operations
    will work, though the cell name containing white space will have
    to be quoted when given in the prompt area and elsewhere.  The use
    of white space in cell names can lead to trouble and is
    discouraged.

    <p>
    In the present release, by default, white space is not permitted
    in cell names.  When reading archive files, the cell name alias
    mechanism (described below) is used to convert white space
    characters found in cell names to underscore characters.  Attempts
    to open a new cell with a name containing white space will fail. 
    However, white space is allowed, as in older <i>Xic</i> releases,
    if the <a href="NoStrictCellnames"><b>NoStrictCellnames</b></a>
    variable is set.

    <p>
    There is provision for modifying cell names as archive files are
    read, written, or format converted.  The <a href="xic:imprt">Import

    during their respective operations.  This module contains the
    following controls:

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Auto-Rename</b><dd>
    This is a choice in the <b>Default when new cells conflict</b>
    menu in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a href="xic:imprt"><b>Import
    Control</b> panel.  Selecting this item sets the state of the <a
    href="AutoRename"><b>AutoRename</b></a> variable.  When set, cell
    names that clash with the name of a cell in memory encountered
    when an archive file is being read into memory will be changed to
    avoid a clash.

    <p>
    This will apply to files read with the <a
    href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command and equivalent, in
    addition to files opened from the panels and through script
    functions.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Prefix</b> and <b>Suffix</b> text entries<dd>
    Text entered into these text areas will be added as a prefix or
    suffix to cells encountered when reading an archive file.  A
    limited text substitution mechanism is available.  In the
    <b>Format Conversion</b> and <b>Import Control</b> panels, these
    text areas track the <a

    If set, <b>To Lower</b> will convert upper case cell names to
    lower case, and <b>To Upper</b> will convert lower case cell names
    to upper.  Mixed case cell names are not affected.  Case
    conversion is performed before any applied prefix/suffix.  In the
    <b>Import Control</b> and <b>Format Conversion</b> panels, these
    buttons track the state of the <a
    href="InToLower"><b>InToLower</b></a> and <a
    href="InToUpper"><b>InToUpper</b></a> variables.  In the <b>Export
    Control</b> panel, these buttons track the state of the <a

    name length to 32 characters.  The character set is limited to
    alpha-numerics plus '<tt>?</tt>', '<tt>_</tt>', and '<tt>$</tt>'. 
    This action is automatic when writing GDSII files and can not be
    disabled.

These buttons control whether an alias file (see next section) is read
before a file is processed, and updated after processing is complete. 
In the {\cb Import Control} and {\cb Format Conversion} panels, the
buttons track the {\et InUseAlias} variable, and in the {\cb Export

Aliasing from the alias file is applied before any other name change.

This will apply to files read with the panels and through

\item{GDSII conformance}\\
When writing GDSII files, cell names will be forced to conform to the
GDSII specification.  For format level 3, this limits the cell name
length to 32 characters.  The character set is limited to
alpha-numerics plus `{\vt ?}', `{\vt \_}', and `{\vt \$}'.  This
action is automatic when writing GDSII files and can not be disabled.

\item{Device Library name clashes}\\
When reading any of the archive formats into memory, if a cell name is

Cell Name Alias File
!!HTML
    When reading and writing archive files, an alias file may be used
    or created.  This file controls the renaming of cells between
    <i>Xic</i> and the archive file.  Use of the alias file is
    optional, and by default is neither created or used.

    <p>
    The <a href="InUseAlias"><b>InUseAlias</b></a> variable, if set
    (with the <a href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command or equivalent
    buttons), enables utilization of the alias file when reading from
    an archive.  Similarly, the <a
    href="OutUseAlias"><b>OutUseAlias</b></a> variable enables
    utilization of the alias file when writing to an archive.  These
    variables have corresponding buttons in the panels found in the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu">Convert Menu</a>.

    <p>
    If the variable is simply set as a boolean, i.e., to no value, the
    alias file will be read before a read or write operation, and
    created or updated if necessary after the operation completes.  If
    the variable is set to a word starting with 'r' (case
    insensitive), then the alias file will be read before the
    operation and used during the operation (if it exists), but will
    not be created or updated after the operation completes.  If the
    variable is set to a word starting with 'w' or 's' (case
    insensitive), the alias file will not be read before an operation,
    but will be created or updated after the operation completes.

    <p>
    If enabled, after a read/write operation on an archive file, an
    alias file may be created, or updated if it already exists.  This
    file will be created in the same directory as the archive file,
    where it must remain in order to be found.  The name of the alias
    file is the same as that of the archive file, with "<tt>.gz</tt>"
    stripped (if present) and "<tt>.alias</tt>" appended.

    <p>
    The alias file consists of lines with two tokens:  the first token
    is a cell name found in the archive file, and the second token is
    the name of the cell as known to <i>Xic</i>, which will be
    different from the first token (i.e., cell names that are
    unchanged do not appear).  The file will be used, if it exists and
    the operation is enabled, to translate cell names to and from the
    archive format, as the file is written or read.  The alias file will
    be written or updated, if necessary and the operation is enabled,
    after an operation that reads or writes an archive file.  No file
    is produced unless a name was changed.

    <p>
    On reading or writing an archive file, a name will potentially change if
    any of the cell name <a hef="cellname">aliasing</a> features are enabled.
    This includes enforcement of the GDSII standard for cell names when
    writing GDSII.  Any name change will be indicated in the log
    file.  If a name changes, the alias file will be updated, if updating
    is enabled.  The sense of the substitutions from the alias file is
    reversed when reading vs. writing.

    <p>
    It is not an error if no alias file exists.

    <p>
    When the alias file utilization is enabled, one should be aware
    that the alias file is controlling cell naming when converting to
    and from that file, since occasionally this can lead to confusion. 
    The values in the alias file have precedence over other directives,
    such as case changes.  For example, suppose that an archive file
    is created with case mapping applied.  This will produce an alias
    file, if updating is enabled.  If the case conversion is then
    turned off, and the write operation repeated to the same file name
    with alias file reading enabled, the cell names will <i>still</i>
    be case-converted, due to the alias file.  Similarly, when reading
    the archive file produced, the cell names will be back-converted
    by the alias file.  If the translations are no longer wanted, the
    switches controlling alias file usage should be turned off, or the
    alias file deleted.

    <p>
    Note that it is possible for the user to hand edit the alias
    file to produce an arbitrary cell name mapping.  For example, it
    might be used to convert all cell names in a design to
    non-descriptive random strings before sending a design file to
    another site, to mask the function of the circuitry.
!!LATEX aliasfile cvrtmenu.tex
When reading and writing archive files, an alias file may be used or
created.  This file controls the renaming of cells between {\Xic} and
the archive file.  Use of the alias file is optional, and by default
is neither created or used.

The {\et InUseAlias} variable, if set (with the {\cb !set} command or
equivalent buttons), enables utilization of the alias file when
reading from an archive.  Similarly, the {\et OutUseAlias} variable
enables utilization of the alias file when writing to an archive. 
These variables have corresponding buttons in the panels found in the
{\cb Convert Menu}.

If the variable is simply set as a boolean, i.e., to no value, the
alias file will be read before a read or write operation, and created
or updated if necessary after the operation completes.  If the
variable is set to a word starting with `{\vt r}' (case insensitive),
then the alias file will be read before the operation and used during
the operation (if it exists), but will not be created or updated after
the operation completes.  If the variable is set to a word starting
with `{\vt w}' or `{\vt s}' (case insensitive), the alias file will
not be read before an operation, but will be created or updated after
the operation completes.

If enabled, after a read/write operation on an archive file, an alias
file may be created, or updated if it already exists.  This file will
be created in the same directory as the archive file, where it must
remain in order to be found.  The name of the alias file is the same
as that of the archive file, with ``{\vt .gz}'' stripped (if present)
and ``{\vt .alias}'' appended.

The alias file consists of lines with two tokens:  the first token is
a cell name found in the archive file, and the second token is the
name of the cell as known to {\Xic}, which will be different from the
first token (i.e., cell names that are unchanged do not appear).  The
file will be used, if it exists and the operation is enabled, to
translate cell names to and from the archive format, as the file is
written or read.  The alias file will be written or updated, if
necessary and the operation is enabled, after an operation that reads
or writes an archive file.  No file is produced unless a name was
changed.

On reading or writing an archive file, a name will potentially change
if any of the cell name aliasing features are enabled.  This includes
enforcement of the GDSII standard for cell names when writing GDSII. 
Any name change will be indicated in the log file.  If a name changes,
the alias file will be updated, if updating is enabled.  The sense of
the substitutions from the alias file is reversed when reading vs. 
writing.

It is not an error if no alias file exists.

When the alias file utilization is enabled, one should be aware that
the alias file is controlling cell naming when converting to and from

!!TITLE
Layer Names
!!HTML
    <i>Xic</i> follows the Virtuoso/OpenAccess concept of component
    layers, purposes, and layer-purpose pairs.  Component layers are
    represented by a name and a number, and are abstract.  Likewise,
    purposes are an abstraction represented by a name and a number. 
    An actual <i>Xic</i> layer, which appears in the layer table, is
    a layer-purpose pair.
    
    <p>
    Every <i>Xic</i> layer has a component layer name and purpose.
    The name of an <i>Xic</i> layer is given or printed in the form
    <blockquote>
    <i>component_layer</i>[<tt>:</tt><i>purpose</i>]
    </blockquote>
    If the purpose name is "<tt>drawing</tt>", then it is not printed
    or given explicitly.  Otherwise, the purpose is separated from
    the component layer name by a colon ('<tt>:</tt>') character. 
    Note that when the purpose is <tt>drawing</tt>, the <i>Xic</i>
    layer name is simply the component layer name, so if the only
    purpose used is <tt>drawing</tt>, the distinction between
    component and <i>Xic</i> layer names vanishes.

    <p>
    Example <i>Xic</i> layer names:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>m1</tt>
    <tt>m1:pin</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The first name corresponds to component layer name <tt>m1</tt>
    and purpose <tt>drawing</tt>.  The second example uses a purpose
    named "<tt>pin</tt>".

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, layer names of both types, and purpose names, are
    always recognized and treated without case-sensitivity.  There is
    no limit on the length of these names.  Component layer and
    purpose names can contain alphanumeric characters plus dollar sign
    ('<tt>$</tt>') and underscore ('<tt>_</tt>').

    <p>
    All of the component layer and purpose names also have
    corresponding numbers.  These may be assigned by the user, or
    assigned internally by <i>Xic</i>.  <i>Xic</i> will maintain the
    associations, but the numbers are not used by <i>Xic</i>.  They
    are, however, important for compatibility with other tools such
    as Virtuoso.

    <p>
    All <i>Xic</i> layers may be given an alias name.  The layer will
    be recognized by this name, as well as its normal name. 
    <i>Xic</i> layers may also contain a description string,
    presentation attributes such as color and fill pattern, and a host
    of other flags and properties for use within <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    When working with GDSII and other files that use a numeric
    layer/datatype combination to designate layers, the layer/datatype
    combinations can be mapped into arbitrary <i>Xic</i> layers using
    the <a href="gdslayer">mapping constructs</a>.  If no such mapping
    is found, a default name will be used.  The default name strings
    apply to <i>Xic</i> layers that use the default <tt>drawing</tt>
    purpose.

    <p>
    When the layer and datatype numbers are in the range 0-255 the
    default name string takes the form of a four-byte upper case
    hexadecimal integer.  The two left characters indicate the layer
    number, zero padded.  Similarly, the two right characters
    represent the datatype number.  For example, layer 33, datatype 15
    has the name "<tt>210F</tt>".

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> supports layer and datatype numbers in the range
    0-65535.  Although values larger than 255 are outside of the GDSII
    specification, they are compatible with the GDSII file format and
    are used as extensions in some vendor's products.  To represent
    the case where either value is larger than 255, an eight digit hex
    number is used.  This is analogous to the four character encoding,
    but each field uses four characters.

    <p>
    When providing a layer name of this type to <i>Xic</i>, an
    alternate "decimal" form can be used.  This is
    "<i>layer</i>,<i>datatype</i>" where the two integers are
    separated by a comma (no space).  Thus, "<tt>33,15</tt>" is an
    equivalent way to specify the layer name for the example above. 
    This is a convenience for entering layer names into the input
    fields of files and graphical windows of <i>Xic</i>.  Internally,
    the layer name is always stored as the hex name.

    <p>
    In some cases when working with layer/datatype combinations, one
    of the two fields can be a wildcard.  In the hex format, the hex
    digits of the appropriate field can be set to "<tt>X</tt>".  In
    the decimal representation, a single '-' replaces the appropriate
    digits.  For example, "<tt>0FXX</tt>" and "<tt>15,-</tt>"
    equivalently specify layer number 15 and any datatype number.
!!LATEX layername cvrtmenu.tex
{\Xic} follows the Virtuoso/OpenAccess concept of component layers,
purposes, and layer-purpose pairs.  Component layers are represented
by a name and a number, and are abstract.  Likewise, purposes are an
abstraction represented by a name and a number.  An actual {\Xic}
layer, which appears in the layer table, is a layer-purpose pair.

Every {\Xic} layer has a component layer name and purpose.  The name
of an {\Xic} layer is given or printed in the form
\begin{quote}
{\it component\_layer\/}[{\vt :}{\it purpose\/}]
\end{quote}
If the purpose name is ``{\vt drawing}'', then it is not printed or
given explicitly.  Otherwise, the purpose is separated from the
component layer name by a colon (`{\vt :}') character.  Note that when
the purpose is {\vt drawing}, the {\Xic} layer name is simply the
component layer name, so if the only purpose used is {\vt drawing},
the distinction between component and {\Xic} layer names vanishes.

Example {\Xic} layer names:
\begin{quote}
{\vt m1}\\
{\vt m1:pin}
\end{quote}
The first name corresponds to component layer name {\vt m1}
and purpose {\vt drawing}.  The second example uses a purpose
named ``{\vt pin}''.

In {\Xic}, layer names of both types, and purpose names, are always
recognized and treated without case-sensitivity.  There is no limit on
the length of these names.  Component layer and purpose names can
contain alphanumeric characters plus dollar sign (`{\vt \$}') and
underscore (`{\vt \_}').

All of the component layer and purpose names also have corresponding
numbers.  These may be assigned by the user, or assigned internally by
{\Xic}.  {\Xic} will maintain the associations, but the numbers are
not used by {\Xic}.  They are, however, important for compatibility
with other tools such as Virtuoso.

All {\Xic} layers may be given an alias name.  The layer will be
recognized by this name, as well as its normal name.  {\Xic} layers
may also contain a description string, presentation attributes such as
color and fill pattern, and a host of other flags and properties for
use within {\Xic}.

When working with GDSII and other files that use a numeric
layer/datatype combination to designate layers, the layer/datatype
combinations can be mapped into arbitrary {\Xic} layers using the
mapping constructs described in \ref{gdslayer}.  If no such mapping is
found, a default name will be used.  The default name strings apply to
{\Xic} layers that use the default {\vt drawing} purpose.

\index{hex format layer names}
When the layer and datatype numbers are in the range 0--255 the
default name string takes the form of a four-byte upper case
hexadecimal integer.  The two left characters indicate the layer
number, zero padded.  Similarly, the two right characters represent
the datatype number.  For example, layer 33, datatype 15 has the name
``{\vt 210F}''.

{\Xic} supports layer and datatype numbers in the range 0--65535. 
Although values larger than 255 are outside of the GDSII
specification, they are compatible with the GDSII file format and are
used as extensions in some vendor's products.  To represent the case
where either value is larger than 255, an eight digit hex number is
used.  This is analogous to the four character encoding, but each
field uses four characters.

\index{decimal format layer names}
When providing a layer name of this type to {\Xic}, an alternate
``decimal'' form can be used.  This is ``{\it layer\/},{\it
datatype\/}'' where the two integers are separated by a comma (no
space).  Thus, ``{\vt 33,15}'' is an equivalent way to specify the
layer name for the example above.  This is a convenience for entering
layer names into the input fields of files and graphical windows of
{\Xic}.  Internally, the layer name is always stored as the hex name.

In some cases when working with layer/datatype combinations, one of
the two fields can be a wildcard.  In the hex format, the hex digits
of the appropriate field can be set to ``{\vt X}''.  In the decimal
representation, a single `$-$' replaces the appropriate digits.  For
example, ``{\vt 0FXX}'' and ``{\vt 15,$-$}'' equivalently specify
layer number 15 and any datatype number.

GDSII Layer Mapping
!!HTML
    The GDSII file format does not use <a href="layername">layer
    names</a>.  Instead, geometry can exist on a numbered layer and
    datatype.  Typically, the layer number and datatype can be in
    the range 0-255, or 0-63 for some older versions of the GDSII
    specification.  Here, the combination of a GDSII layer number and
    datatype is referred to as a "specification".

    <p>
    Although the GDSII file format documentation, which is maintained
    by Cadence Design Systems, Inc., specifies the 0-255 range for the
    current GDSII release, the file format uses 16-bit integers to
    store these values, and other vendors support layer and datatype
    numbers outside of this range.  <i>Xic</i> release 2.5.67 and
    later can semi-transparently handle layer and datatype values in
    the range 0-65535.

    <p>
    Although this section refers to the GDSII file format, the same
    mapping logic applies when reading OASIS and CGX files, when a
    layer/datatype are given.

    <p>
    When reading a GDSII file, <i>Xic</i> will attempt to map
    specifications encountered into existing <i>Xic</i> layers.  If
    that fails, a new <i>Xic</i> layer will be created.  The GDSII
    mapping for <i>Xic</i> layers is generally assigned in the <a
    href="techfile:layers:conv">technology file</a> using the
    <b>StreamIn</b> keyword (for reading) and <b>StreamOut</b> (for
    writing), or can be specified with the <a href="xic:lpedt"><b>Tech
    Parameter Editor</b></a> from the <b>Edit Tech Params</b> button
    in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  This is the primary means by which
    GDSII specifications are interpreted as <i>Xic</i> layers, but
    this requires <i>a-priori</i> knowledge of the content of the
    GDSII file.

    <p>
    This section describes the process <i>Xic</i> uses to map an
    unknown specification encountered when reading GDSII input, where
    "unknown" means that no suitable mapping exists in the
    <b>StreamIn</b> lines of the present <i>Xic</i> layers.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> will first try to identify an existing <i>Xic</i> layer
    to map to the unknown specification.  The first test is to look
    for an <i>output</i> mapping (as produced with a <b>StreamOut</b>
    line) that matches.  If a match is found, an <i>input</i> mapping
    will be created.  The behavior depends on the setting of the <a
    href="NoMapDatatypes"><b>NoMapDatatypes</b></a> variable, which
    reflects the state of the <b>Map all unmapped GDSII datatypes to
    same Xic layer</b> check box in the <b>Setup</b> page of the <a
    href="xic:imprt"><b>Import Control</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Convert Menu</b>.  When this variable is set (directly with the
    <a href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command, or by the button), the
    datatype will be ignored.  The following pseudo-code illustrates
    the logic:

    <p>
    <pre>
    &nbsp;loop through existing Xic layers {
    &nbsp;  if Xic layer has no GDSII input mapping {
    &nbsp;    if Xic layer output mapping = GDSII layer {
    &nbsp;      if NoMapDatatypes set
    &nbsp;        (use this layer)
    &nbsp;      else if output mapping datatype = GDSII datatype
    &nbsp;        (use this layer)
    &nbsp;    }
    &nbsp;  }
    &nbsp;}
    </pre>

    <p>
    Each layer/datatype specification has an equivalent hex code.  If
    the layer and datatype are less than 256, the hex code is of the
    form <i>LLDD</i>, where the <i>L</i>s are hex digits, zero-padded,
    which represent the layer number, and the <i>D</i>s similarly
    represent the datatype.  If either number is larger than 255, the
    format is <i>LLLLDDDD</i>, which has the same interpretation,
    e.g., the <i>L</i>s are a four-digit zero-padded hex integer
    representing the layer number.  If the <b>NoMapDatatypes</b>
    variable is in effect, the datatype field (the <i>D</i>s) can
    instead be filled with '<tt>X</tt>' characters.

    <p>
    The hex values are produced in upper case, but matching is
    case insensitive.
    <p>

    If no suitable output mapping is found, <i>Xic</i> will look for
    layer names or <a href="LongName">long names</a> which match the
    hex encoding.  If a layer is found with a name or long name
    matching (case-insensitive) the hex code for the specification,
    and that layer has no input mapping, an input mapping will be
    created.  The following pseudo-code illustrates the logic:

    <p>
    <pre>
    &nbsp;if NoMapDatatypes set {
    &nbsp;  if layer and datatype less than 256
    &nbsp;    hex_code = hhXX
    &nbsp;  else
    &nbsp;    hex_code = hhhhXXXX
    &nbsp;}
    &nbsp;else {
    &nbsp;  if layer and datatype less than 256
    &nbsp;    hex_code = hhhh
    &nbsp;  else
    &nbsp;    hex_code = hhhhhhhh
    &nbsp;}
    &nbsp;loop through existing Xic layers {
    &nbsp;  if Xic layer name or long name matches hex_code
    &nbsp;    (use this layer)
    &nbsp;}
    </pre>

    <p>
    If no existing layer is found that can be mapped to, a new layer
    will be created.  If the hex code is four characters, the name of
    the new layer is the same as the hex code.  If the hex code is
    eight characters, the new name is an internally-generated unique
    four-character name, and the long name is assigned the hex code. 
    The layer name in this case is in the form "<i>L???</i>" where
    <i>???</i> is a sequential decimal zero-padded integer, starting
    with "<tt>000</tt>".  This mapping is also used in the
    four-character hex code case, if the hex code conflicts with an
    existing layer name.

    <p>
    After the GDSII file has been read, newly created layers will
    appear in the <a href="layertab">layer menu</a> (they are
    added above existing layers).  The user can modify <a
    href="xic:color">colors</a>, <a href="xic:fill">fill patterns</a>,
    and other attributes for these layers, and dump a new technology
    file with the <a href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command.
!!LATEX gdslayer cvrtmenu.tex
The GDSII file format does not use layer names.  Instead, geometry
can exist on a numbered layer and datatype.  Typically, the layer
number and datatype can be in the range 0--255, or 0--63 for some
older versions of the GDSII specification.  Here, the combination
of a GDSII layer number and datatype is referred to as a
``specification''.

Although the GDSII file format documentation, which is maintained by
Cadence Design Systems, Inc., specifies the 0--255 range for the
current GDSII release, the file format uses 16-bit integers to store
these values, and other vendors support layer and datatype numbers
outside of this range.  {\Xic} release 2.5.67 and later can
semi-transparently handle layer and datatype values in the range
0--65535.

Although this section refers to the GDSII file format, the same
mapping logic applies when reading OASIS and CGX files, when a
layer/datatype are given.

When reading a GDSII file, {\Xic} will attempt to map specifications
encountered into existing {\Xic} layers.  If that fails, a new {\Xic}
layer will be created.  The GDSII mapping for {\Xic} layers is
generally assigned in the technology file using the {\et StreamIn}
keyword (for reading) and {\et StreamOut} (for writing), or can be
specified with the {\cb Tech Parameter Editor} from the {\cb Edit Tech
Params} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu}.  This is the primary
means by which GDSII specifications are interpreted as {\Xic} layers,
but this requires {\it a-priori} knowledge of the content of the GDSII
file.

This section describes the process {\Xic} uses to map an
unknown specification encountered when reading GDSII input, where
``unknown'' means that no suitable mapping exists in the
{\et StreamIn} lines of the present {\Xic} layers.

{\Xic} will first try to identify an existing {\Xic} layer to map to
the unknown specification.  The first test is to look for an {\it
output} mapping (as produced with a {\et StreamOut} line) that
matches.  If a match is found, an {\it input} mapping will be created. 
The behavior depends on the setting of the {\et NoMapDatatypes}
variable, which reflects the state of the {\cb Map all unmapped GDSII
datatypes to same Xic layer} check box in the {\cb Setup} page of the
{\cb Import Control} panel from the {\cb Convert Menu}.  When this
variable is set (directly with the {\cb !set} command, or by the
button), the datatype will be ignored.  The following pseudo-code
illustrates the logic:

\begin{verbatim}
loop through existing Xic layers {
  if Xic layer has no GDSII input mapping {
    if Xic layer output mapping = GDSII layer {
      if NoMapDatatypes set
        (use this layer)
      else if output mapping datatype = GDSII datatype
        (use this layer)
    }
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

Each layer/datatype specification has an equivalent hex code.  If the
layer and datatype are less than 256, the hex code is of the form
{\it LLDD}, where the {\it L\/}s are hex digits, zero-padded, which
represent the layer number, and the {\it D\/}s similarly represent the
datatype.  If either number is larger than 255, the format is {\it
LLLLDDDD}, which has the same interpretation, e.g., the {\it L\/}s are
a four-digit zero-padded hex integer representing the layer number. 
If the {\et NoMapDatatypes} variable is in effect, the datatype field
(the {\it D\/}s) can instead be filled with `{\vt X}' characters.

The hex values are produced in upper case, but matching is case
insensitive.

If no suitable output mapping is found, {\Xic} will look for layer
names or long names which match the hex encoding.  If a layer is found
with a name or long name matching (case-insensitive) the hex code for
the specification, and that layer has no input mapping, an input
mapping will be created.  The following pseudo-code illustrates the
logic:

\begin{verbatim}
if NoMapDatatypes set {
  if layer and datatype less than 256
    hex_code = hhXX
  else
    hex_code = hhhhXXXX
}
else {
  if layer and datatype less than 256
    hex_code = hhhh
  else
    hex_code = hhhhhhhh
}
loop through existing Xic layers {
  if Xic layer name or long name matches hex_code
    (use this layer)
}
\end{verbatim}

If no existing layer is found that can be mapped to, a new layer will
be created.  If the hex code is four characters, the name of the new
layer is the same as the hex code.  If the hex code is eight
characters, the new name is an internally-generated unique
four-character name, and the long name is assigned the hex code.  The
layer name in this case is in the form ``{\it L???}'' where {\it ???}
is a sequential decimal zero-padded integer, starting with ``{\vt
000}''.  This mapping is also used in the four-character hex code
case, if the hex code conflicts with an existing layer name.

After the GDSII file has been read, newly created layers will appear
in the layer menu (they are added above existing layers).  The user
can modify colors, fill patterns, and other attributes for these
layers, and dump a new technology file with the {\cb Save Tech}
command.

    The <b>Export Cell Data</b> button in the <b>Convert Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Export Control</b> panel.  The top of the panel
    contains tabbed pages for <b>GDSII</b>, <b>OASIS</b>, <b>CIF</b>,
    <b>CGX</b>, and <b>Xic cell files</b>.  This selects the current
    output format, and exposes controls and settings particular to the
    format.  The lower part of the panel has two pages.  The
    <b>Setup</b> page allows setting of various format-independent
    parameters and modes which are used globally when writing layout
    files.  The <b>Write File</b> page provides a button with which
    export of cell data to a disk file can be initiated, as well as
    settings which apply during the write operation.

    <p>
    Below are descriptions of the controls in the file format pages
    selected by the upper tabs.  Clicking the tab exposes the page
    containing controls appropriate for the format.  The parameters
    set with this panel always apply when writing layout files of the
    types indicated.  In particular, the settings apply when the
    commands in the <b>File Menu</b> are used to save design data, as
    well as when the <b>Write File</b> button in this panel is used.

    <dt><b>GDSII version number, polygon/wire vertex limit</b><dd>
    This option menu effectively sets the <a
    href="GdsOutLevel"><b>GdsOutLevel</b></a> variable.  This
    determines the release number given in the GDSII file, and also
    sets limits on the number of vertices allowed in polygon and wire
    objects included in the file.  If an object in the database has
    too many vertices, it will be written to the file as multiple
    objects, which cover the same area.  The default is GDSII format
    release 7, which allows up to 8000 polygon or path vertices.  It
    may be necessary to use one of the format release 3 choices if the
    file is to be read by older software.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Skip layers without Xic to GDSII layer mapping</b><dd>
    When this button is active, layers without a GDSII <a
    href="techfile:layers:conv">output mapping</a> will be ignored
    when producing GDSII or OASIS output, though a warning will appear
    in the log file.  Otherwise, this is an error which terminates
    the operation.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="NoGdsMapOk"><b>NoGdsMapOk</b></a> with the
    <b>!set</b> command.

    <p>
    GDSII files can be gzip compressed.  Such files are recognized
    automatically on input, and can be coerced as output by giving
    a "<tt>.gz</tt>" suffix to the file name.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Accept but truncate too-long strings</b><dd>
    The GDSII and CGX formats use a 16-bit integer to store record size,
    limiting the size of records to 64KB.  This prevents storage of
    stings longer than this.  By default, an attempt to write such a
    string to a GDSII or CGX file will generate a fatal error,
    aborting the operation.  If this check box is set, overrunning
    strings will be truncated to maximum possible length, and the
    operation will continue without error.  Warnings will appear in
    the log file, however.

    <p>
    The check box tracks the state of the <a

    <dt><b>Unit Scale</b><dd>
    This entry area contains a value that will multiply the default
    values of the "machine unit" and "user unit" parameters which are
    used in the GDSII file, and all coordinates in the file will be
    divided by this value.  The default values for these parameters
    are
    <blockquote>

    where <i>resolution</i> is the internal resolution, which defaults
    to 1000 per-micron, but can be changed with the <a
    href="DatabaseResolution"><b>DatabaseResolution</b></a> variable. 
    It is not likely that the user will need to set this, and unless
    the user understands the implications it is recommended that the
    default value (1.0) be used.  This entry area is an interface to

    compression will be used.

    <p>
    NOTE:  <b>compressed OASIS files are not compatible between the

    <dt><b>Use string tables</b><dd>
    When active, all strings including cell names, properties, and

    strings will be referenced by number.  This should reduce file
    size.  When not active, each string will be saved locally for each

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Find repetitions</b><dd>
    When active, an attempt is made to identify identical objects that are
    placed in multiple locations, and use REPETITION records in OASIS output
    instead of writing multiple object records.  This should reduce file
    size, but can be compute-intensive.  When not active, no attempt is
    made to use REPETITION records, except for cell arrays.

    <p>
    See the description of the <a
    href="OasWriteRep"><b>OasWriteRep</b></a> variable, which controls
    the use of REPETITION records in OASIS output.  The <b>Advanced
    OASIS Export Parameters</b> panel contains an interface for
    effectively setting the <b>OasWriteRep</b> variable string.  The
    <b>Find repetitions</b> button will set this variable to the

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Write crc checksum</b><dd>
    When active, a cyclic-redundancy (CRC) checksum is added to OASIS

    <dt><b>Extension Flags</b><dd>
    This drop-down menu provides access to a number of checkable
    buttons which correspond to flags which enable various CIF format
    extensions.  There are two banks of flags, the bank displayed is
    initially determined by the state of the <b>Strip For Export</b>
    button in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel,
    or equivalently the state of the <a
    href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> variable.  The top
    entry of the menu indicates this state.  Clicking this entry will
    switch the menu to display and control the other bank of flags. 
    The default values for the flags in the <b>Strip For Export</b>
    inactive case are all set, so all extensions are turned on.  The
    other bank has all flags unset, so by default no extensions will
    be used when <b>Strip For Export</b> is set.  However, the status
    of any of the flags can be toggled with this menu.

    <p>
    The flag states track the value of the <a
    href="CifOutExtensions"><b>CifOutExtensions</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    The format extensions enabled by these flags are described in the
    <a href="symfilefmt#cifext">CIF format extensions</a>.
    </dl>

    The lower section of the CIF page contains three option menus
    which control aspects of the syntax used when writing CIF files. 
    The three selectable variations are the syntax used for the cell
    name extension, the interpretation of the "<tt>L</tt>
    <i>layer</i>;" syntax element, and the syntax used for the label
    extension.  <i>Xic</i> can handle almost transparently any of
    these syntax variations, however third-party applications may
    require a specific variation.

    <p>
    The selections shown in the menus tracks the value encoded in the
    <a href="CifOutStyle"><b>CifOutStyle</b></a> variable.  When this
    variable is unset, the defaults (the first choice in each menu)
    are used.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Last Seen</b><dd>
    When a CIF file is read into memory, the style of the CIF file is
    saved internally.  Pressing the <b>Last Seen</b> button will
    update the three style menus to these saved values, by setting or
    clearing the <b>CifOutStyle</b> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF Cell Name Extensions</b><dd>
    Cell names were not part of the original CIF syntax specification. 
    Various extensions have been used to supply cell names in a CIF
    file.  Each of these extensions consists of command following the
    "<tt>DS</tt> ...;" command, in the following forms:

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>cname_index</th><th>Historic Name</th><th>Format</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td> IGS</td><td>    <tt>9</tt> <i>cell_name</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td> Stanford/NCA</td><td> (<i>cell_name</i>);</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td> Icarus</td><td> (<tt>9</tt> <i>cell_name</i>);</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td> Sif</td><td> (<tt>Name:</tt> <i>cell_name</i>);</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td> none</td><td>         no extension used</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, any of the first four forms (indices 0-3) will be
    recognized equivalently when reading CIF input.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF Layer Specification</b><dd>

    Layers are specified in CIF in a command with syntax
    <blockquote>
    <tt>L</tt> <i>token</i>;
    </blockquote>

    The the <i>token</i> can be interpreted in two ways; as the name
    of a layer, or as an index into a layer table.  For the second
    interpretation, the token must of course be an integer.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>layer_index</th><th>  Historic Name</th><th>   Format</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>  none</td><td>  <tt>L</tt> <i>layer_name</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>  NCA</td><td>   <tt>L</tt> <i>layer_index</i>;</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Of these, the first entry is most common.  <i>Xic</i> can handle
    both of these interpretations (see
    <a href="xic:imprt#layerspec"><b>Import Control</b></a>).

    <p>
    If the indexing is selected for layers, the index will be 1-based,
    and correspond to the layers, left to right, in the layer table,
    i.e., the leftmost (lowest) layer in the layer table is designated
    index 1.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF Label Extensions</b><dd>

    Text labels were not part of the original CIF syntax
    specification, so that various extensions are used to pass label
    information.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>label_index</th><th>  Historic Name</th><th>   Format</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td> Xic</td><td>
     <tt>94</tt> &#60&#60<i>label</i>>>
     <i>x y orient_code width height</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td> KIC</td><td>    <tt>94</tt> <i>label x y</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td> NCA</td><td>
     <tt>92</tt> <i>label x y layer_index</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td> Mextra</td><td>
     <tt>94</tt> <i>label x y layer_name</i>;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td> none</td><td> no labels used</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Unlike other extensions, the first extension listed above is
    unique to <i>Xic</i>.  If other formats are used, label size and
    orientation information will be lost.  When reading CIF input, any
    of these forms will be accepted.

    The <b>Setup</b> page contains a number of check boxes which control
    various modes when writing output, as described below.

    <a name="invis">
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Don't convert invisible layers</b><dd>
    There are separate check boxes that apply to physical and
    electrical modes.  When active, only layers that are currently
    visible, as selected with <a href="button2">button 2</a> in the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a>, will be written when writing
    output using this panel.  This is the method by which certain
    layers can be eliminated from generated output.  When this button
    button is not active, all <i>Xic</i> layers will be written.

    <p>
    This feature can also be enabled by setting the variable <a
    href="SkipInvisible"><b>SkipInvisible</b></a> with the <b>!set</b>
    command.
    </dl>

    <a name="strip">
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Strip For Export</b><dd>
    When the <b>Strip For Export</b> button is active, converted
    output will contain physical data only, and will contain no
    <i>Xic</i> extensions.  Further, the <b>Strip For Export</b> check
    box implicitly enables the same functionality as <b>Include
    library cell masters</b> (see below), so that the file will not contain
    unresolved library cell references.  Additionally, parameterized
    cell and standard via sub-masters will be included in output, as
    if the corresponding check boxes were also checked.  The <b>Strip
    For Export</b> box should be checked when creating a file for use
    in generating photomasks.  Note that the electrical information
    can never be recovered from a stripped file.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> with the
    <b>!set</b> command.  The variable tracks the state of the check box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include library cell masters</b><dd>
    If the input references library cells (which have the LIBRARY <a
    href="xic:cells#flags">flag</a> set) whose masters are not found
    in the file, then these masters are not written to output unless
    this box is checked.  With the box not checked, the output file
    will require the referenced library be preesent and open when the
    file is read into <i>Xic</i> (the same requirement as the input
    file).  With the box checked, the masters are written to the
    output file, which will therefor not need the library.

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the <a
    href="KeepLibMasters"><b>KeepLibMasters</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include parameterized cell sub-masters</b><dd>
    When this check box is checked, output saved to disk files will
    include <a href="xic:pcells">sub-master</a> cells.  Ordinarily,
    sub-master cells are not included, as they will be re-created when
    the file is read.  However, when exporting to a system that does
    not support the pcells in use, the sub-masters must be written if
    the file is to have any value.  With the sub-masters present, the
    cells/instances will look like normal cell placements.

    <p>
    This applies when writing all output, <b>except</b> when using the
    <a href="xic:sv"><b>Save</b></a> and <a href="xic:save"><b>Save
    As</b></a> buttons in the <b>File Menu</b>, and the equivalent
    text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting the
    program.  It is also ignored when using the <a
    href="Save"><tt>Save</tt></a> script function.

!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> native pcells are only supported in <i>Xic</i>. 
    OpenAccess-based pcells might be supported by other systems, that
    is certainly the intent of the Ciranova PyCells.  Even if another
    system supports the OpenAccess PyCells, it may not have the logic
    to rebuild the pcells coming from a GDSII or other file source. 
    In that case one will probably have to ship the OpenAccess library
    files.
!!ENDIF

    <p>
    The <a href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> variable
    and the equivalent check box will have the same effect when set.

    When checked, <a href="stdvia">standard via</a> cell sub-masters

    sending output to another system, as this implementation is
    specific to <i>Xic</i>.
!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    An exception may be systems that share an OpenAccess database
    with <i>Xic</i>.  If the cells are written to the OpenAccess

    <dt><b>Ignore labels in subcells when flattening</b><dd>
    When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked
    labels found in subcells are ignored, meaning not reparented to
    the top level.  Pre-existing labels at the top level are not
    affected.  This is intended to prevent net name labels from

    a file with this panel.  Unlike the settings described above,
    these settings apply only to files created with this panel.

    <p>
    The currently selected tab at the top of the panel specifies the
    output format to use.  Details of the format selections are
    described below.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>GDSII</b><dd>
    This choice will create a GDSII (Stream) file of the current

    File</b>, the name of the file for the GDSII output is requested
    from the user.  The user can add a "<tt>.gz</tt>" extension, or
    remove the extension if already present, to control whether or not
    <tt>gzip</tt> compression is used.  The GDSII layer numbers and
    datatypes are as given in the <a

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> will ensure that cell names included in the GDSII
    file conform to the standard (upper and lower case, digits, '_',
    '$', '?' only, up to 32 long in GDSII Release 3).

    <p>
    All layers that are to be written to the GDSII file should have a

    layer numbers and datatypes are as given in the <a
    href="techfile:layers:conv">technology file</a>.  These are the
    same as for GDSII.

    <p>
    All layers that are to be written to the OASIS file should have a
    GDSII output mapping specified.  This can be added to the <a
    href="techfile">technology file</a> with a text editor, or
    interactively with the <a href="xic:lpedt"><b>Edit Tech
    Params</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  By default,
    a layer needed for output that does not have a mapping will
    terminate the operation.  However, if the <b>Skip layers without
    Xic to GDSII layer mapping</b> check box in the <b>OASIS</b> page
    of the <b>Export Control</b></a> panel is checked, or equivalently
    the variable <b>NoGdsMapOk</b> is set (with the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command), then such layers will be
    ignored (producing no output).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF</b><dd>
    With this choice, the current editing cell and its descendents
    will be written to a CIF file.  Upon pressing <b>Write File</b>,
    the user is prompted for the name of the file for CIF output.

    <p>
    The extension syntax used for cell name specification and labels,
    and whether the layer directives use indexing or names, are
    settable with the <a href="CifOutStyle"><b>CifOutStyle</b></a>
    variable and/or the <b>CIF</b> page menus in the <b>Export
    Control</b> panel.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CGX</b><dd>
    <p>
    With this choice, the current editing cell and its descendents
    will be written to a CGX file.  Upon pressing <b>Write File</b>,
    the user is prompted for the name of the file for CGX output.  The
    user can add a "<tt>.gz</tt>" extension, or remove the extension
    if already present, to control whether or not <tt>gzip</tt>
    compression is used.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Xic Cell Files</b><dd>
    This choice will unconditionally write to native-format files the
    hierarchy of the current editing cell.  It can be used to
    transform a hierarchy input from a <a href="xic:fsaf">supported
    archive format</a> file into <i>Xic</i> native format.

    <p>
    When <b>Write File</b> is pressed, the user is given the option of
    setting the directory which will receive the created files.  If no
    directory is given, the files will be created in the current
    directory.  While the prompt is in effect, a pop-up containing a
    tree listing of the directory hierarchy rooted in the current
    directory appears.  The user can select a directory in the
    listing, or type the directory path on the prompt line.  If a
    directory path is given and the final directory does not exist, it
    will be created, if possible.  Pressing <b>Esc</b> will abort the
    operation.

    <p>
    After the cell writing is complete, a <a href="libraries">library
    file</a> will be written in the current directory, given the name
    of the top-level cell suffixed with "<tt>.lib</tt>".  This file
    will have references to each of the new files created, with the
    top-level cell name listed first, and the others listed in
    alphabetical order.  This library may be placed in the search path
    to gain access to the new files through the library mechanism, in
    which case the directory containing the files need not be in the
    search path.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The following controls are found in the <b>Write File</b> page.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Cell Name Mapping</b><dd>
    This group of controls manages the cell name <a

    </dl>
!!LATEX xic:exprt cvrtmenu.tex
The {\cb Export Cell Data} button in the {\cb Convert Menu} brings up
the {\cb Export Control} panel.  The top of the panel contains tabbed
pages for {\cb GDSII}, {\cb OASIS}, {\cb CIF}, {\cb CGX}, and {\cb Xic
cell files}.  This selects the current output format, and exposes
controls and settings particular to the format.  The lower part of the
panel has two pages.  The {\cb Setup} page allows setting of various
format-independent parameters and modes which are used globally when
writing layout files.  The {\cb Write File} page provides a button
with which export of cell data to a disk file can be initiated, as
well as settings which apply during the write operation.

Below are descriptions of the controls in the file format pages
selected by the upper tabs.  Clicking the tab exposes the page
containing controls appropriate for the format.  The parameters set
with this panel always apply when writing layout files of the types
indicated.  In particular, the settings apply when the commands in the
{\cb File Menu} are used to save design data, as well as when the {\cb
Write File} button in this panel is used.

\subsection{GDSII Settings}

\begin{description}
\index{GDSII version number setting}
\item{\cb GDSII version number, polygon/wire vertex limit}\\
This option menu effectively sets the {\et GdsOutLevel} variable. 
This determines the release number given in the GDSII file, and also
sets limits on the number of vertices allowed in polygon and wire
objects included in the file.  If an object in the database has too
many vertices, it will be written to the file as multiple objects,
which cover the same area.  The default is GDSII format release 7,
which allows up to 8000 polygon or path vertices.  It may be necessary
to use one of the format release 3 choices if the file is to be read
by older software.

\index{Skip layers button}
\item{\cb Skip layers without Xic to GDSII layer mapping}\\
When this button is active, layers without a GDSII output mapping will
be ignored when producing GDSII or OASIS output, though a warning will
appear in the log file.  Otherwise, this is an error which terminates
the operation.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
NoGdsMapOk} with the {\cb !set} command.

GDSII files can be gzip compressed.  Such files are recognized
automatically on input, and can be coerced as output by giving a
``{\vt .gz}'' suffix to the file name.

\item{\cb Accept but truncate too-long strings}\\
The GDSII and CGX formats use a 16-bit integer to store record size,
limiting the size of records to 64KB.  This prevents storage of stings
longer than this.  By default, an attempt to write such a string to a
GDSII or CGX file will generate a fatal error, aborting the operation. 
If this check box is set, overrunning strings will be truncated to
maximum possible length, and the operation will continue without
error.  Warnings will appear in the log file, however.

The check box tracks the state of the {\cb GdsTruncateLongStrings}
variable.

\item{\cb Unit Scale}\\
This entry area contains a value that will multiply the default values
of the ``machine unit'' and ``user unit'' parameters
which are used in the GDSII file, and all coordinates in the file will
be divided by this value.  The default values for these parameters
are
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
machine unit: & 1e-6/{\it resolution}\\
user unit: & 1.0/{\it resolution}\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
where {\it resolution} is the internal resolution, which defaults to
1000 per-micron, but can be changed with the {\et DatabaseResolution}
variable.  It is not likely that the user will need to set this, and
unless the user understands the implications it is recommended that
the default value (1.0) be used.  This entry area is an interface to
the {\et GdsMunit} variable.

\end{description}

\subsection{OASIS Settings}

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Advanced}\\
This button brings up the {\cb Advanced OASIS Export Parameters}
panel, which allows modification of the more obscure features employed
when writing OASIS output (see \ref{oasadv}).

\item{\cb Skip layers without Xic to GDSII layer mapping}\\
This is equivalent to the corresponding button on the GDSII page.

\item{\cb Use compression}\\
When active, created OASIS files will use compression.  The contents
of each CELL record and name table will be placed in a CBLOCK record,
which should reduce file size.  When not active, no compression will
be used.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
OasWriteCompressed} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Use string tables}\\
When active, all strings including cell names, properties, and labels
are saved in indirection tables.  Throughout the file, strings will be
referenced by number.  This should reduce file size.  When not active,
each string will be saved locally for each reference.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
OasWriteNameTab} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Find repetitions}\\
When active, an attempt is made to identify identical objects that are
placed in multiple locations, and use REPETITION records in OASIS
output instead of writing multiple object records.  This should reduce
file size, but can be compute-intensive.  When not active, no attempt
is made to use REPETITION records, except for cell arrays.

See the description of the {\et OasWriteRep} variable (in
\ref{OasWriteRep}), which controls the use of REPETITION records in
OASIS output.  The {\cb Advanced OASIS Export Parameters} panel
contains an interface for effectively setting the {\et OasWriteRep}
variable string.  The {\cb Find repetitions} button will set this
variable to the current string, or unset the variable.  With the
default parameters, the string is empty.

\item{\cb Write crc checksum}\\
When active, a cyclic-redundancy (CRC) checksum is added to OASIS
output files (OASIS validation method 1).  When not active, no
checksum is added.

See the description of the {\et OasWriteChecksum} variable (in
\ref{OasWriteChecksum}), which controls the validation method in OASIS
output.  This variable can be set explicitly to use byte-sum checksum
validation (OASIS validation method 2).  The check box sets/unsets
this variable as a boolean.
\end{description}

\subsection{CIF Settings}
\label{cifsettings}

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Extension Flags}\\
This drop-down menu provides access to a number of checkable buttons
which correspond to flags which enable various CIF format extensions. 
There are two banks of flags, the bank displayed is initially
determined by the state of the {\cb Strip For Export} button in the
{\cb Export Control} panel, or equivalently the state of the {\et
StripForExport} variable.  The top entry of the menu indicates this
state.  Clicking this entry will switch the menu to display and
control the other bank of flags.  The default values for the flags in
the {\cb Strip For Export} inactive case are all set, so all
extensions are turned on.  The other bank has all flags unset, so by
default no extensions will be used when {\et Strip For Export} is set. 
However, the status of any of the flags can be toggled with this menu.

The flag states track the value of the {\et CifOutExtensions}
variable.

The format extensions enabled by these flags are described in
\ref{cifext}, CIF Format Extensions.
\end{description}

The lower section of the CIF page contains three option menus which
control aspects of the syntax used when writing CIF files.  The three
selectable variations are the syntax used for the cell name extension,
the interpretation of the ``{\vt L} {\it layer\/}{\vt ;}'' syntax
element, and the syntax used for the label extension.  {\Xic} can
handle almost transparently any of these syntax variations, however
third-party applications may require a specific variation.

The selections shown in the menus tracks the value encoded in the {\et
CifOutStyle} variable.  When this variable is unset, the defaults (the
first choice in each menu) are used.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Last Seen}\\
When a CIF file is read into memory, the style of the CIF file is
saved internally.  Pressing the {\cb Last Seen} button will update the
three style menus to these saved values, by setting or clearing the
{\et CifOutStyle} variable.

\item{\cb CIF Cell Name Extensions}\\
Cell names were not part of the original CIF syntax specification. 
Various extensions have been used to supply cell names in a CIF file. 
Each of these extensions consists of command following the ``{\vt DS
...;}'' command, in the following forms:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\kb cname\_index & \kb Historic Name & \kb Format\\
0 & IGS          & {\vt 9} {\it cell\_name};\\
1 & Stanford/NCA & ({\it cell\_name});\\
2 & Icarus       & ({\vt 9} {\it cell\_name});\\
3 & Sif          & ({\vt Name:} {\it cell\_name});\\
4 & none         & no extension used\\
\end{tabular}

In {\Xic}, any of the first four forms (indices 0--3) will be
recognized equivalently when reading CIF input.

\item{\cb CIF Layer Specification}\\
Layers are specified in CIF in a command with syntax
\begin{quote}
{\vt L} {\it token};
\end{quote}

The the {\it token} can be interpreted in two ways; as the name of a
layer, or as an index into a layer table.  For the second
interpretation, the token must of course be an integer.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\kb layer\_index & \kb Historic Name & \kb Format\\
0 & none &  {\vt L} {\it layer\_name};\\
1 & NCA  &  {\vt L} {\it layer\_index};\\
\end{tabular}

Of these, the first entry is most common.  {\Xic} can handle both of
these interpretations (see \ref{cvimport}).

If the indexing is selected for layers, the index will be 1--based, and
correspond to the layers, left to right, in the layer table, i.e., the
leftmost (lowest) layer in the layer table is designated index 1.

\item{\cb CIF Label Extensions}\\
Text labels were not part of the original CIF syntax specification, so
that various extensions are used to pass label information.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\kb label\_index & \kb Historic Name & \kb Format\\
0 & Xic & {\vt 94} {\vt <<}{\it label\/}{\vt >>} {\it x y orient\_code width height};\\
1 & KIC & {\vt 94} {\it label x y};\\
2 & NCA & {\vt 92} {\it label x y layer\_index};\\
3 & Mextra & {\vt 94} {\it label x y layer\_name};\\
4 & none  & no labels used\\
\end{tabular}

Unlike other extensions, the first extension listed above is unique to
{\Xic}.  If other formats are used, label size and orientation
information will be lost.  When reading CIF input, any of these forms
will be accepted.
\end{description}

\subsection{CGX Settings}

This page contains an {\cb Accept but truncate too-long strings} check
box, with purpose and functionality that is identical to the check box
in the {\cb GDSII} page.

CGX files can be gzip compressed.  Such files are recognized
automatically on input, and can be coerced as output by giving a
``{\vt .gz}'' suffix to the file name.

\subsection{The Setup Page}

The {\cb Setup} page contains a number of check boxes which control
various modes when writing output, as described below.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Don't convert invisible layers}\\
\index{Don't convert invisible layers button}
\index{conversion, file format!layer suppression}
There are separate check boxes that apply to physical and electrical
modes.  When active, only layers that are currently visible, as
selected with button 2 in the layer table, will be written when
writing output using this panel.  This is the method by which certain
layers can be eliminated from generated output.  When this button
button is not active, all {\Xic} layers will be written.

This feature can also be enabled by setting the variable {\et
SkipInvisible} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Strip For Export}\\
\index{StripForExport button}
\index{exporting designs!Strip For Export}
\index{compatibility!Strip For Export}
When the {\cb Strip For Export} button is active, converted output
will contain physical data only, and will contain no {\Xic}
extensions.  Further, the {\cb Strip For Export} check box implicitly
enables the same functionality as {\cb Include library cell masters} (see
below), so that the file will not contain unresolved library cell
references.  Additionally, parameterized cell and standard via
sub-masters will be included in output, as if the corresponding check
boxes were also checked.  The {\cb Strip For Export} box should be
checked when creating a file for use in generating photomasks.  Note
that the electrical information can never be recovered from a stripped
file.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
StripForExport} with the {\cb !set} command.  The variable tracks the
state of the check box.

\item{\cb Include library cell masters}\\
If the input file references library cells (which have the LIBRARY
flag set) whose masters are not found in the file, then these masters
are not written to output unless this box is checked.  With the box
not checked, the output file will require the referenced library be
preesent and open when the file is read into {\Xic} (the same
requirement as the input file).  With the box checked, the masters are
written to the output file, which will therefor not need the library.

This tracks the state of the {\et KeepLibMasters} variable.

\item{\cb Include parameterized cell sub-masters}\\
When this check box is checked, output saved to disk files will
include sub-master cells.  Ordinarily, sub-master cells are not
included, as they will be re-created when the file is read.  However,
when exporting to a system that does not support the pcells in use,
the sub-masters must be written if the file is to have any value. 
With the sub-masters present, the cells/instances will look like
normal cell placements.

This applies when writing all output, {\bf except} when using the {\cb
Save} and {\cb Save As} buttons in the {\cb File Menu}, and the
equivalent text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting
the program.  It is also ignored when using the {\vt Save} script
function.

%\ifoa
{\Xic} native pcells are only supported in {\Xic}.  OpenAccess-based
pcells might be supported by other systems, that is certainly the
intent of the Ciranova PyCells.  Even if another system supports the
OpenAccess PyCells, it may not have the logic to rebuild the pcells
coming from a GDSII or other file source.  In that case one will
probably have to ship the OpenAccess library files.
%\fi

The {\et StripForExport} variable and the equivalent check box will
have the same effect when set.

The {\et PCellKeepSubMasters} variable tracks the state of this check
box.

\item{\cb Include standard via cell sub-masters}\\
When checked, standard via cell sub-masters are included in the output
file.  This will be required when sending output to another system, as
this implementation is specific to {\Xic}.
%\ifoa
An exception may be systems that share an OpenAccess database with
{\Xic}.  If the cells are written to the OpenAccess database, the
standard vias should translate properly, and be recognized by other
tools (e.g., Virtuoso) that share the database.
%\fi

This applies when writing all output, {\bf except} when using the {\cb
Save} and {\cb Save As} buttons in the {\cb File Menu}, and the
equivalent text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting
the program.  It is also ignored when using the {\vt Save} script
function.

The {\et StripForExport} variable and the equivalent check box will
have the same effect when set.

The {\et ViaKeepSubMasters} variable tracks the state of this check
box.

\item{\cb Consider ALL cells in current symbol table for output}\\
When checked, all cells in the current symbol table, not just the
hierarchy of the current cell, will be output as if they were part of
the hierarchy.  The usual filtering of library and sub-master cells is
retained.  The resulting file may have multiple top-level cells.
This mirrors the state of the {\vt OutAllCells} boolean varible.

\item{\cb Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of standard vias are retained as such, rather than
being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the state of the
{\et NoFlattenStdVias} variable.

\item{\cb Don't flatten pcells, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of parameterized cells (pcells) are retained as such,
rather than being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the
state of the {\et NoFlattenPCells} variable.

\item{\cb Ignore labels in subcells when flattening}\\
When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked labels
found in subcells are ignored, meaning not reparented to the top
level.  Pre-existing labels at the top level are not affected.  This
is intended to prevent net name labels from subcells conflicting with
net name labels defined at higher hierarchy levels.  The check box
state tracks the {\et NoFlattenLabels} variable.

\item{\cb Keep bad output (for debugging)}\\
When generating an archive file and an error occurs, the archive file
will normally be deleted.  However, if this box is checked.  the
output file will be given a ``{\vt .BAD}'' extension and retained. 
This file should be considered corrupt, but may be useful for
diagnostics.  This tracks the {\et KeepBadArchive} variable.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Write File Page, Exporting Design Data}

The {\cb Write File} page is used to initiate writing of a design data
file to disk.  A number of options are available when writing a file
with this panel.  Unlike the settings described above, these settings
apply only to files created with this panel.

The currently selected tab at the top of the panel specifies the
output format to use.  Details of the format selections are described
below.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb GDSII}\\
This choice will create a GDSII (Stream) file of the current editing
cell and its descendents.  Upon pressing {\cb Write File}, the name of
the file for the GDSII output is requested from the user.  The user
can add a ``{\vt .gz}'' extension, or remove the extension if already
present, to control whether or not {\vt gzip} compression is used. 
The GDSII layer numbers and datatypes are as given in the technology
file.

\index{GDSII cell names}
{\Xic} will ensure that cell names included in the GDSII file
conform to the standard (upper and lower case, digits, `\_', `\$', `?'
only, up to 32 long in GDSII Release 3).

\index{NoGdsMapOk variable}
All layers that are to be written to the GDSII file should have a
GDSII output mapping specified.  This can be added to the technology
file with a text editor, or interactively with the {\cb Edit Tech
Params} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu}.  By default, a layer
needed for output that does not have a mapping will terminate the
operation.  However, if the {\cb Skip layers without Xic to GDSII
layer mapping} check box in the {\cb GDSII} page of the {\cb Export
Control} panel is checked, or equivalently the variable {\et
NoGdsMapOk} is set (with the {\cb !set} command), then such layers
will be ignored (producing no output).

\item{\cb OASIS}\\
This choice will create an OASIS file of the current editing cell and
its descendents.  Upon pressing {\cb Write File}, he name of the file
for the OASIS output is requested from the user.  The layer numbers
and datatypes are as given in the technology file.  These are the same
as for GDSII.

All layers that are to be written to the OASIS file should have a
GDSII output mapping specified.  This can be added to the technology
file with a text editor, or interactively with the {\cb Edit Tech
Params} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu}.  By default, a layer
needed for output that does not have a mapping will terminate the
operation.  However, if the {\cb Skip layers without Xic to GDSII
layer mapping} check box in the {\cb OASIS} page of the {\cb Export
Control} panel is checked, or equivalently the variable {\et
NoGdsMapOk} is set (with the {\cb !set} command), then such layers
will be ignored (producing no output).

\item{\cb CIF}\\
With this choice, the current editing cell and its descendents will be
written to a CIF file.  Upon pressing {\cb Write File}, the user is
prompted for the name of the file for CIF output.

The extension syntax used for cell name specification and labels, and
whether the layer directives use indexing or names, are settable with
the {\et CifOutStyle} variable and/or the {\cb CIF} page menus in the
{\cb Export Control} panel.

\item{\cb CGX}\\
With this choice, the current editing cell and its descendents will be
written to a CGX file.  Upon pressing {\cb Write File}, the user is
prompted for the name of the file for CGX output.  The user can add a
``{\vt .gz}'' extension, or remove the extension if already present,
to control whether or not {\vt gzip} compression is used.

\item{\cb Xic Cell Files}\\
This choice will unconditionally write to native-format files the
hierarchy of the current editing cell.  It can be used to transform a
hierarchy input from a supported archive format file into {\Xic}
native format.

When {\cb Write File} is pressed, the user is given the option of
setting the directory which will receive the created files.  If no
directory is given, the files will be created in the current
directory.  While the prompt is in effect, a pop-up containing a tree
listing of the directory hierarchy rooted in the current directory
appears.  The user can select a directory in the listing, or type the
directory path on the prompt line.  If a directory path is given and
the final directory does not exist, it will be created, if possible. 
Pressing {\kb Esc} will abort the operation.

After the cell writing is complete, a library file will be written in
the current directory, given the name of the top-level cell suffixed
with ``{\vt .lib}''.  This file will have references to each of the
new files created, with the top-level cell name listed first, and the
others listed in alphabetical order.  This library may be placed in
the search path to gain access to the new files through the library
mechanism, in which case the directory containing the files need not
be in the search path.
\end{description}

The following controls are found in the {\cb Write File} page.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Cell Name Mapping}\\
This group of controls manages the cell name aliasing feature.  This
does not apply to native cell file output.

\item{\cb Windowing and Flattening}\\
A subset of the windowing operations is available.  From this panel,
windowing is only available when flattening.

\item{\cb Conversion Scale Factor}\\
The {\cb Conversion Scale Factor} provides an entry area where a scale
factor to be applied during the write operation can be entered. 
Values of 0.001 through 1000.0 are acceptable.  This will apply to
output initiated from this panel only.

\item{Write File}\\
The write is actually initiated with the {\cb Write File} button.  The
name of the output file will be prompted for on the prompt line.

Cell files can also be written to disk using the {\cb Save} and {\cb
Save As} commands in the {\cb File Menu}.  However, if scaling or
other options available in this panel are required, the file must be
generated from this panel.

The {\cb Advanced OASIS Export Parameters} panel is provided from the
{\cb Advanced} button in the {\cb OASIS} setup page of various panels,
including the {\cb Export Control} panel, the {\cb Format Conversion}
panel and the {\cb Layout File Merge Tool}, all from the {\cb Convert
Menu}.  It allows modification of the more arcane parameters used when
generating OASIS output.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Don't write trapezoid records}\\
This check box sets and unsets the {\et OasWriteNoTrapezoids}
variable.  When set, no attempt is made to save three and four-sided
polygons in more compact trapezoid records.  Setting this variable
will likely increase file size but reduce writing time.

\item{\cb Convert Wire to Box records when possible}\\
This check box sets and unsets the {\et OasWriteWireToBox} variable. 
When set, single-segment Manhattan wires will be saved in more compact
rectangle records.  This may reduce file size, at the expense of
slightly longer writing time and loss of object type integrity.

\item{\cb Convert rounded-end Wire records to Poly records}\\
This check box sets and unsets the {\et OasWriteRndWireToPoly}
variable.  When set, rounded-end wires, which don't have native OASIS
support and are normally converted to extended-end (Manhattan
extension) wires, are instead converted to polygons.  The polygons
require more memory than the wires, but preserve exactly the geometric
coverage of the original layout, as rendered in {\Xic}.

\item{\cb Skip GCD check}\\
This check box sets and unsets the {\et OasWriteNoGCDcheck} variable. 
When set, the OASIS writer will not attempt to divide out a common
factor in vertex lists, which is done to reduce file size but can have
significant computational overhead.

\item{\cb Use alternate modal sort algorithm}\\
This check box sets and unsets the {\et OasWriteUseFastSort} variable. 
When set, an older, less effective sorting algorithm is used to
sequence objects in output to make use of modality.  Use of this
algorithm may reduce writing time but will potentially increase file
size.

\item{\cb Property masking}\\
This menu controls the {\et OasWritePrptyMask} variable, which can be
used to avoid writing certain, or all properties.  This can reduce
file size if properties are not needed.  The description of this
variable explains this feature in detail.
\end{description}

The remaining controls provide an interface for setting the text
string for the {\et OasWriteRep} variable, which is used to control
the repetition finder.  Use of the repetition finder is
enabled/disabled by the {\cb Find repetitions} check box in the {\cb
OASIS} page of the {\cb Export Control} panel.  The present panel sets
the parameters to use when the repetition finder is enabled.

The repetition finder is a system that will identify identical
objects, and attempt to identify periodic sequences of these objects
in one and two dimensions.  This can have a huge effect on file size,
at the expense of computational overhead.  The controls on this panel
can be used to fine-tune the algorithm for a particular data set,
producing, e.g., the smallest file, or reducing writing time.

The description of the {\et OasWroteRep} variable provides detailed
information about the parameters found in the property string, which
has the form:
\begin{quote}
    {\et OasWriteRep}: [{\it word\/}] [{\vt d}] [{\vt r}]
     [{\vt m}={\it N\/}] [{\vt a}={\it N\/}] [{\vt x}={\it N\/}]
     [{\vt t}={\it N\/}]
\end{quote}

The {\cb Restore Defaults} button will reset all controls to the
default values.  The {\cb Objects} check boxes control which object
types are processed for repetitions, as for the {\it word} in the
string.

The {\cb Run minimum} is the value passed for the {\vt m} option. 
Pressing the {\cb None} button on this line will instead give the {\vt
r} option, and gray out the run and array controls.  The {\cb Array
minimum} provides the value for the {\vt a} option.  The {\cb None}
button on this line will emit ``{\vt a=0}'' and disable the entry
area.  The {\cb Max different objects} line corresponds to the {\vt x}
option.  The {\cb Max similar objects} line corresponds to the {\vt t}
option.  If the {\cb None} button in this line is pressed, ``{\vt
t=0}'' will be emitted and the entry area is grayed.  Note that these
do not emit if the text area contains the default value.

To actually enable repetitions, the {\et OasWriteReps} variable must
be set.  This can be set by hand with the {\cb !set} command or
equivalent, in which case the controls above will take the values
found in the string.  Setting the {\cb Find repetitions} check box in
the {\cb OASIS} page of the {\cb Export Control} panel will also set
the variable, to a string created from the state of the controls. 
When the variable is set, the listing of set variables brought up with
the {\cb !set} command without arguments can ge used to monitor the
property string as the various controls are changed.

    The <b>Import Cell Data</b> button in the <b>Convert Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Import Control</b> panel.  The panel has two
    pages, the first is used to set various parameters that apply
    globally when reading design data into the <i>Xic</i> internal
    database.  The second page provides the means to initiate reading
    data from disk files into <i>Xic</i>.

    <a name=setup></a>
    <h2>The Setup Page</h2>

    <img src="screenshots/cvin1.png" align=right>
    This page contains a number of entries which control various
    defaults and features that apply when reading data files.  These
    settings always apply when reading, in particular during use of
    the commands in the <b>File Menu</b>, as well as through use of
    the <b>Read File</b> page of this panel.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>PCell evaluation:  Don't eval native</b><dd>
    Setting this check box will prevent evaluation of native <a
    href="pcell">pcells</a> when an instance is found while reading
    file input.  If an archive file contains the sub-masters, it is
    more efficient to use them rather than recreate them through
    evaluation.  Note that if sub-masters are not provided, the
    super-masters for the pcells must be available.

    Setting this check box will cause <i>Xic</i> to attempt to

    encountered when reading file input.  By default, this is not
    done, as evaluation is likely to fail, and the exporter has
    probably included the sub-master cells in the archive.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Don't create new layers when reading, abort instead</b><dd>
    By default, when reading an input file, layers are created if
    necessary to match layers found in the file.  The new layers are
    appended to the <a href="layertab">layer table</a>.  If the source
    is GDSII or another format such as OASIS that provides layer and
    datatype numbers, the new layer name will be an <a
    href="gdslayer">encoding</a> of these numbers.

    <p>
    If this box is checked, new layers will not be created, and
    encountering a layer in input that is not mappable into an existing
    <i>Xic</i> layer will be treated as a fatal error.

    <p>
    The boolean <a href="NoCreateLayer"><tt>NoCreateLayer</tt></a>
    variable tracks the state of the check box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Default when new cells conflict</b><dd>
    This menu determines the default behavior when a cell from a file
    being read conflicts with the name of a cell already in memory. 
    There are five choices:  <b>Overwrite All</b>, <b>Overwrite
    Phys</b>, <b>Overwrite Elec</b>, <b>Overwrite None</b>, and
    <b>Auto Rename</b>.  If <b>AutoRename</b> is selected, when a name
    clash with a cell in memory is detected, the cell name of the cell
    being read is automatically changed to avoid the clash.  A suffix
    "<tt>$</tt><i>N</i>" is added to the cell name, where <i>N</i> is
    a small integer, and a warning message is added to the log file. 
    The <b>Merge Control</b> pop-up will never appear in this mode. 
    For the other four choices, in graphical mode, when a conflict is
    detected, the <b>Merge Control</b> pop-up will appear, if enabled. 
    The initial state of the pop-up will be determined by this menu,
    but the actions can be modified by the user on a per-cell basis. 
    If the pop-up does not appear either because it has been
    suppressed or the program is running in non-graphical (server or
    batch) mode, the default action will be performed.

    <p>
    The default cell name conflict behavior can also be set with three
    boolean variables:  <a href="AutoRename"><b>AutoRename</b></a>, <a
    href="NoOverwritePhys"><b>NoOverwritePhys</b></a> and <a
    href="NoOverwriteElec"><b>NoOverwriteElec</b></a>.  If
    <b>AutoRename</b> is set (with the <b>!set</b> command or
    otherwise), the other two variables are ignored, and the
    auto-rename mode is enabled.  If none of these variables is set,
    then the default action is <b>Overwrite All</b>.

    <p>
    When a cell is encountered while reading an archive file or native
    cell into memory with the same name as a cell already in memory,
    and we are overwriting cells in memory, the new cell will
    overwrite the existing cell in memory in most cases.  The
    exception is for existing cells that were read through the <a
    href="xic:libs">library mechanism</a>.  These cells have the
    IMMUTABLE (read-only) and LIBRARY <a
    href="xic:cells#flags">flags</a> set.

    <p>
    The IMMUTABLE flag has no bearing on whether or not a cell can be
    overwritten in memory.  The overwritten cell will no longer be
    IMMUTABLE.  In releases prior to 3.0.11, IMMUTABLE cells would not
    be overwritten.

    <p>
    If the existing cell has the LIBRARY flag set, it will be
    overwritten, unless the <a
    href="NoOverwriteLibCells"><b>NoOverwriteLibCells</b></a> variable
    is set.  A warning message will be included in the log file in
    this case, but the read will be successful, with the result being
    as if overwriting was not enabled.  If overwritten, the cell will
    no longer have the LIBRARY flag set.  In releases prior to 3.0.11,
    LIBRARY cells would always be overwritten, unless IMMUTABLE was
    also set, which is the default for library cells.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Don't prompt for overwrite instructions</b><dd>
    In graphical mode, when a cell name clash with a cell already in
    memory is detected while reading a file, the <b>Merge Control</b>
    pop-up may appear.  This can be used to change whether or not to
    overwrite the cell in memory on a per-cell and per-mode basis. 
    When this button is active, the <b>Merge Control</b> pop-up will
    not appear, and the overwriting will use the default setting.

    <p>
    This state can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="NoAskOverwrite"><b>NoAskOverwrite</b></a> with the
    <b>!set</b> command.

    <a name="merge">
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Clip and merge overlapping boxes</b><dd>
    When this button is on, <a href="xic:box">boxes</a> on the same
    layer are merged together, if possible, as files are being read
    into the database.  Overlapping boxes are clipped and/or merged. 
    This applies to box objects only, and not polygons (even
    rectangular ones) or wires, and applies only for physical mode
    data.  Electrical mode boxes are never merged.  This tracks the
    setting of the boolean variable <a
    href="MergeInput"><b>MergeInput</b></a>, which can (equivalently)
    be set with the <b>!set</b> command.

    <p>
    This mode applies when reading input from a layout file only, and
    is separate and unrelated to the object merging as controlled from
    the <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Menu</b>.  These settings have no effect when reading
    layout data.

    <p>
    However, on layers where the <a
    href="NoMerge"><tt>NoMerge</tt></a> technology file keyword is
    set, box (or any object) merging is inhibited, in all cases.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Skip testing for badly formed polygons</b><dd>
    When set, the reentrancy test for polygons is skipped while an
    input file is being read into the database.  The default behavior
    is to check each polygon for potentially troublesome geometry
    specification while the polygon is being created.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="NoPolyCheck"><b>NoPolyCheck</b></a> with the <b>!set</b>
    command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Duplicate item handling</b><dd>
    When reading data from a layout file, identical objects and
    subcells placed on top of one another are sometimes found. 
    Although these generally cause no harm, this is almost always a
    layout error.  This menu provides three choices of how to handle
    the situation.  The default action is to print a warning in the
    log file, but import the duplicate objects into the database.  The
    <b>Remove Duplicates</b> choice will also issue a warning, but
    will not add the duplicates to the database.  The third choice
    suppresses checking for duplicates entirely.

    <p>
    This menu tracks the status of the <a
    href="DupCheckMode"><b>DupCheckMode</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Skip testing for empty cells</b><dd>
    When set, there is no checking for empty cells as an input file is
    being read into the database, and the pop-up that normally appears
    when a file is opened for editing or viewing if there are empty
    cells in the hierarchy is suppressed.  An "empty cell" actually
    means that both physical and electrical cells of this name either
    don't exist in the hierarchy, or contain nothing.  It is possible
    to check for empty cells at any time with the <a
    href="!empties"><b>!empties</b></a> command.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="NoCheckEmpties"<b>NoCheckEmpties</b></a> with the
    <b>!set</b> command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Map all unmapped GDSII datatypes to same Xic layer</b><dd>
    This setting affects only the creation of new layers when a GDSII
    or OASIS file is read into the database.  The default behavior is
    to create a separate new <i>Xic</i> layer for each GDSII
    layer/datatype encountered that is not mapped in the technology
    file.  With the variable set, all datatypes on the new GDSII layer
    are mapped to the same (new) <i>Xic</i> layer.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="NoMapDatatypes"><b>NoMapDatatypes</b></a> with the <b>!set</b>
    command.
    </dl>

    <a name="layerspec">
    <dl>
    <dt><b>How to resolve CIF layers</b><dd>
    This is an option menu which specifies how <i>Xic</i> interprets
    layer directives in CIF files.

    <p>
    The layer directive has the syntax
    <blockquote>
    <tt>L</tt> <i>token</i>;
    </blockquote>

    If the <i>token</i> is an integer, it might indicate the name of
    a layer with the name being the same integer string, or it might
    be an index into the layer table.  The choices in the menu enforce
    these two behaviors.

    <p>
    The default resolution method (<b>Try Both</b>) works as follows: 
    The parser reads "<tt>L</tt> <i>token</i>;".  If <i>token</i>
    matches an existing layer name (as string comparison), that layer
    is accepted.  If there is no matching layer, and the <i>token</i>
    is an integer in the range of 1 through a maximum number, and
    there is no leading 0, the token is tested as an index.  if a
    layer exists with that 1-based index, that layer is chosen.  If
    the layer still has not been resolved, a new layer is created in
    the layer table, with the given (numerical) name.

    <p>
    The option menu gives two additional choices.  The <b>By Name</b>
    choice will skip the index test.  If the string match fails with
    all existing layers, a new layer will be created.  If the <b>By
    Index</b> choice is selected, the layer tokens are assumed to be
    integers.  The string match test is skipped.  If the index test
    fails, an error is reported and the operation aborts.  New layers
    are never created in this mode.  The layer tokens must be positive
    integers with no leading zeros that have a corresponding layer
    table entry.

    <p>
    The <b>CifLayerMode</b> variable corresponds to this set of
    options, where its value of 0-2 corresponds to the three choices.

    <dt><b>Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instance at top

    When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked
    labels found in subcells are ignored, meaning not placed in the
    current cell.  Labels defined in the current cell are not
    affected.  This is intended to prevent net name labels from
    subcells conflicting with net name labels defined at higher
    hierarchy levels.  The check box state tracks the <a

    <dt><b>Skip reading text labels from physical archives</b><dd> When
    set, text labels will not be read from a layout file when reading

    text labels, though not physical objects, should be assumed to be
    present for a purpose.  However, this check box gives the user the
    flexibility to strip these out.

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, text labels are included when the bounding box of a
    cell is computed.  If a text label actually determines the
    boundary of a cell, the bounding box of the cell may report
    differently from other tools.  The effective size of a text
    label is not well defined, and other tools will probably make
    different assumptions about font size, etc., or may not include
    text labels in bounding box computations.

    later time.

    <p>
    If <b>No Merge Into Current</b> is the current selection, then
    merging is turned off.  Reading a cell of the same name as the
    current cell can either overwrite the current cell or the new cell
    can be ignored, depending on how name clashes are currently
    handled (as set in the <b>Setup</b> page of this panel).

    <p>
    If one of <b>Merge Cell Into Current</b> or <b>Merge Into Current
    Recursively</b> is selected, and the <b>Read File</b> button is
    pressed, the following operations will be performed.  The user
    will be prompted for a file name.  The user can respond with the
    name of a file, or the name of a cell in memory.

    <p>
    If the user passes a cell name found in memory, the contents of
    that cell will be duplicated and added to the current cell.  This
    completes the command.  Note that there is no difference between
    the <b>Merge Cell Into Current</b> and <b>Merge Into Current
    Recursively</b> modes in this case.

    <p>
    If the file name is found on disk, the file will be opened in a
    temporary <a href="xic:stabs">symbol table</a>.  If a cell is
    found in the temporary symbol table that has the same name as the
    current cell, the contents of that cell will be merged into the
    current cell.  Otherwise, the user will be prompted for a cell
    name.  If the user enters a valid cell name, the contents of that
    cell will be duplicated into the current cell.  If the menu is set
    to <b>Merge Cell Into Current</b>, the command is done.  The
    temporary symbol table will be cleared.

    <p>
    If a recursive merge is selected, the hierarchy of the current
    cell is traversed.  For each cell in the hierarchy, if a cell with
    the same name exists in the temporary symbol table, the contents
    of that cell will be duplicated into its counterpart under the
    current cell.  Care is taken to handle the details of this
    recursive merge cleanly.

    <p>
    There is no undo capability for this command, so be sure to save a
    copy of the current cell hierarchy before merging, in case of
    trouble.

!!LATEX xic:imprt cvrtmenu.tex
The {\cb Import Cell Data} button in the {\cb Convert Menu} brings
up the {\cb Import Control} panel.  The panel has two pages, the first
is used to set various parameters that apply globally when reading
design data into the {\Xic} internal database.  The second page
provides the means to initiate reading data from disk files into
{\Xic}.

\subsection{The {\cb Setup} Page}

This page contains a number of entries which control various defaults
and features that apply when reading data files.  These settings
always apply when reading, in particular during use of the commands in
the {\cb File Menu}, as well as through use of the {\cb Read File}
page of this panel.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb PCell evaluation:  Don't eval native}\\
Setting this check box will prevent evaluation of native pcells when
an instance is found while reading file input.  If an archive file
contains the sub-masters, it is more efficient to use them rather than
recreate them through evaluation.  Note that if sub-masters are not
provided, the super-masters for the pcells must be available.
 
This check box tracks the state of the {\et NoEvalNativePCells}
variable.
 
%\ifoa
\item{\cb PCell evaluation:  Eval OpenAccess}\\
Setting this check box will cause {\Xic} to attempt to evaluate
OpenAccess pcells when instances are encountered when reading file
input.  By default, this is not done, as evaluation is likely to fail,
and the exporter has probably included the sub-master cells in the
archive.

This check box tracks the state of the {\et EvalOaPCells} variable. 
%\fi

\item{\cb Don't create new layers when reading, abort instead}\\
By default, when reading an input file, layers are created if
necessary to match layers found in the file.  The new layers are
appended to the layer table.  If the source is GDSII or another format
such as OASIS that provides layer and datatype numbers, the new layer
name will be an encoding of these numbers (see \ref{gdslayer}).

If this box is checked, new layers will not be created, and
encountering a layer in input that is not mappable into an existing
{\Xic} layer will be treated as a fatal error.

The boolean {\et NoCreateLayer} variable tracks the state of the check
box.

\item{\cb Default when new cells conflict}\\
This menu determines the default behavior when a cell from a file
being read conflicts with the name of a cell already in memory.  There
are five choices:  {\cb Overwrite All}, {\cb Overwrite Phys}, {\cb
Overwrite Elec}, {\cb Overwrite None}, and {\cb Auto Rename}.  If {\cb
AutoRename} is selected, when a name clash with a cell in memory is
detected, the cell name of the cell being read is automatically
changed to avoid the clash.  A suffix ``{\vt \$}{\it N}'' is added to
the cell name, where {\it N} is a small integer, and a warning message
is added to the log file.  The {\cb Merge Control} pop-up will never
appear in this mode.  For the other four choices, in graphical mode,
when a conflict is detected, the {\cb Merge Control} pop-up will
appear, if enabled.  The initial state of the pop-up will be
determined by this menu, but the actions can be modified by the user
on a per-cell basis.  If the pop-up does not appear either because it
has been suppressed or the program is running in non-graphical (server
or batch) mode, the default action will be performed.

The default cell name conflict behavior can also be set with three
boolean variables:  {\et AutoRename}, {\et NoOverwritePhys} and {\et
NoOverwriteElec}.  If {\et AutoRename} is set (with the {\cb !set}
command or otherwise), the other two variables are ignored, and the
auto-rename mode is enabled.  If none of these variables is set, then
the default action is {\cb Overwrite All}.

When a cell is encountered while reading an archive file or native
cell into memory with the same name as a cell already in memory, and
we are overwriting cells in memory, the new cell will overwrite the
existing cell in memory in most cases.  The exception is for existing
cells that were read through the library mechanism.  These cells have
the IMMUTABLE (read-only) and LIBRARY flags set.
 
The IMMUTABLE flag has no bearing on whether or not a cell can be
overwritten in memory.  The overwritten cell will no longer be
IMMUTABLE.  In releases prior to 3.0.11, IMMUTABLE cells would not be
overwritten.

If the existing cell has the LIBRARY flag set, it will be overwritten,
unless the {\et NoOverwriteLibCells} variable is set.  A warning
message will be included in the log file in this case, but the read
will be successful, with the result being as if overwriting was not
enabled.  If overwritten, the cell will no longer have the LIBRARY
flag set.  In releases prior to 3.0.11, LIBRARY cells would always be
overwritten, unless IMMUTABLE was also set, which is the default for
library cells.

\item{\cb Don't prompt for overwrite instructions}\\
In graphical mode, when a cell name clash with a cell already in
memory is detected while reading a file, the {\cb Merge Control}
pop-up may appear.  This can be used to change whether or not to
overwrite the cell in memory on a per-cell and per-mode basis.  When
this button is active, the {\cb Merge Control} pop-up will not appear,
and the overwriting will use the default setting.

This state can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
NoAskOverwrite} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Clip and merge overlapping boxes}\\
When this button is on, boxes on the same layer are merged together,
if possible, as files are being read into the database.  Overlapping
boxes are clipped and/or merged.  This applies to box objects only,
and not polygons (even rectangular ones) or wires, and applies only
for physical mode data.  Electrical mode boxes are never merged.  This
tracks the setting of the boolean variable {\et MergeInput}, which can
(equivalently) be set with the {\cb !set} command.

This mode applies when reading input from a layout file, and is
separate and unrelated to the object merging as controlled from the
{\cb Editing Setup} panel from the {\cb Edit Menu}.  These settings
have no effect when reading layout data.

However, on layers where the {\vt NoMerge} technology file keyword is
set, box (or any object) merging is inhibited, in all cases.

\item{\cb Skip testing for badly formed polygons}\\
When set, the reentrancy test for polygons is skipped while an input
file is being read into the database.  The default behavior is to
check each polygon for potentially troublesome geometry specification
while the polygon is being created.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
NoPolyCheck} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Duplicate item handling}\\
When reading data from a layout file, identical objects and subcells
placed on top of one another are sometimes found.  Although these
generally cause no harm, this is almost always a layout error.  This
menu provides three choices of how to handle the situation.  The
default action is to print a warning in the log file, but import the
duplicate objects into the database.  The {\cb Remove Duplicates}
choice will also issue a warning, but will not add the duplicates to
the database.  The third choice suppresses checking for duplicates
entirely.

This menu tracks the status of the {\et DupCheckMode} variable.

\item{\cb Skip testing for empty cells}\\
When set, there is no checking for empty cells as an input file is
being read into the database, and the pop-up that normally appears
when a file is opened for editing or viewing if there are empty cells
in the hierarchy is suppressed.  An ``empty cell'' actually means that
both physical and electrical cells of this name either don't exist in
the hierarchy, or contain nothing.  It is possible to check for empty
cells at any time with the {\cb !empties} command.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
NoCheckEmpties} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb Map all unmapped GDSII datatypes to same Xic layer}\\
This setting affects only the creation of new layers when a GDSII or
OASIS file is read into the database.  The default behavior is to
create a separate new {\Xic} layer for each GDSII layer/datatype
encountered that is not mapped in the technology file.  With the
variable set, all datatypes on the new GDSII layer are mapped to the
same (new) {\Xic} layer.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
NoMapDatatypes} with the {\cb !set} command.

\item{\cb How to resolve CIF layers}\\
This is an option menu which specifies how {\Xic} interprets layer
directives in CIF files.

The layer directive has the syntax
\begin{quote}
{\vt L} {\it token}{\vt ;}
\end{quote}

If the {\it token} is an integer, it might indicate the name of a
layer with the name being the same integer string, or it might be an
index into the layer table.  The choices in the menu enforce these two
behaviors.

The default resolution method ({\cb Try Both}) works as follows:  The
parser reads ``{\vt L} {\it token}{\vt ;}''.  If {\it token} matches
an existing layer name (as string comparison), that layer is accepted. 
If there is no matching layer, and the {\it token} is an integer in
the range of 1 through a maximum number, and there is no leading 0,
the token is tested as an index.  if a layer exists with that 1-based
index, that layer is chosen.  If the layer still has not been
resolved, a new layer is created in the layer table, with the given
(numerical) name.

The option menu gives two additional choices.  The {\cb By Name}
choice will skip the index test.  If the string match fails with all
existing layers, a new layer will be created.  If the {\cb By Index}
choice is selected, the layer tokens are assumed to be integers.  The
string match test is skipped.  If the index test fails, an error is
reported and the operation aborts.  New layers are never created in
this mode.  The layer tokens must be positive integers with no leading
zeros that have a corresponding layer table entry.

The {\et CifLayerMode} variable corresponds to this set of options,
where its value of 0--2 corresponds to the three choices.

\item{\cb Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of standard vias are retained as such, rather than
being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the state of the
{\et NoFlattenStdVias} variable.

\item{\cb Don't flatten pcells, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of parameterized cells (pcells) are retained as such,
rather than being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the
state of the {\et NoFlattenPCells} variable.

\item{\cb Ignore labels in subcells when flattening}\\
When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked labels
found in subcells are ignored, meaning not placed in the current cell. 
Labels defined in the current cell are not affected.  This is intended
to prevent net name labels from subcells conflicting with net name
labels defined at higher hierarchy levels.  The check box state tracks
the {\et NoFlattenLabels} variable.

\item{\cb Skip reading text labels from physical archives}\\
When set, text labels will not be read from a layout file when reading
physical-mode data.  It is not generally advisable to use this, as
text labels, though not physical objects, should be assumed to be
present for a purpose.  However, this check box gives the user the
flexibility to strip these out.

In {\Xic}, text labels are included when the bounding box of a cell is
computed.  If a text label actually determines the boundary of a cell,
the bounding box of the cell may report differently from other tools. 
The effective size of a text label is not well defined, and other
tools will probably make different assumptions about font size, etc.,
or may not include text labels in bounding box computations.

The state of this check box tracks the status of the {\et
NoReadLabels} variable.
\end{description}

\subsection{The {\cb Read File} Page}

This page provides a button to initiate reading a design data file
into {\Xic}, and various controls which set modes which will apply
while reading.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Merge Into Current mode}\\
This menu provides the option of merging the contents of another cell
into the current cell, possibly recursively.  Only the content
associated with the present display mode is affected, for example in
Electrical mode, only the electrical cells will be affected, the
physical cells are untouched.  Part of the motivation for this mode is
to facilitate separate development of electrical and physical designs,
allowing them to be merged at a later time.

If {\cb No Merge Into Current} is the current selection, then merging
is turned off.  Reading a cell of the same name as the current cell
can either overwrite the current cell or the new cell can be ignored,
depending on how name clashes are currently handled (as set in the
{\cb Setup} page of this panel).

If one of {\cb Merge Cell Into Current} or {\cb Merge Into Current
Recursively} is selected, and the {\cb Read File} button is pressed,
the following operations will be performed.  The user will be prompted
for a file name.  The user can respond with the name of a file, or the
name of a cell in memory.

If the user passes a cell name found in memory, the contents of that
cell will be duplicated and added to the current cell.  This completes
the command.  Note that there is no difference between the {\cb Merge
Cell Into Current} and {\cb Merge Into Current Recursively} modes in
this case.

If the file name is found on disk, the file will be opened in a
temporary symbol table.  If a cell is found in the temporary symbol
table that has the same name as the current cell, the contents of that
cell will be merged into the current cell.  Otherwise, the user will
be prompted for a cell name.  If the user enters a valid cell name,
the contents of that cell will be duplicated into the current cell. 
If the menu is set to {\cb Merge Cell Into Current}, the command is
done.  The temporary symbol table will be cleared.

If a recursive merge is selected, the hierarchy of the current cell is
traversed.  For each cell in the hierarchy, if a cell with the same
name exists in the temporary symbol table, the contents of that cell
will be duplicated into its counterpart under the current cell.  Care
is taken to handle the details of this recursive merge cleanly.

There is no undo capability for this command, so be sure to save a
copy of the current cell hierarchy before merging, in case of trouble.

\item{\cb Cell Name Mapping}\\
This group of controls manages the cell name aliasing feature.  The
{\cb Auto-Rename} button found here has the same functionality as the
{\cb Auto Rename} selection in the cell name resolution option menu. 
This applies only when reading archive input files, and not native
cell files.  The prefix/suffix modifications are applied only in input
initiated from this panel or script functions.

\item{\cb Layer Modification}\\
The layer change module allows layer filtering and/or mapping to be
applied during the read operation.  This applies when reading physical
data only.

\item{\cb Windowing and Flattening}\\
Windowing is available only when flattening.  When flattening, all
information read from a file is mapped intto the top-level cell in
memory.  Users should realize that flat representation can require
lots of memory.

\item{\cb Conversion Scale Factor}\\
The {\cb Conversion Scale Factor} provides an entry area where a scale
factor to be applied during reading can be entered.  Values of 0.001
through 1000.0 are acceptable.  This will apply to input initiated
from this panel only.

\item{\cb Read File}\\
The {\cb Read File} button will prompt the user for a file to read
into {\Xic}, in the manner of the {\cb Open} command.  However for
archive files scaling, layer filtering, etc.  may be applied to the
cells read from the file through use of this panel and not via the
{\cb Open} command.

    The windowing module is available in the <a

    though not all features are available in some contexts.  The
    module controls whether windowing and/or flattening is done when
    layout data are being processed.

    <a name="wind"></a>
    <h2>Windowing</h2>

    <p>
    The <b>Use Window</b> button controls whether or not a rectangular
    area is to be used.  If this button is set, only the objects that
    intersect this area will appear in the output.  For subcells, only
    the objects that appear within the window for some instance will
    be converted in the corresponding cell.  The rectangular area can
    be set with the <b>Left</b>, <b>Bottom</b>, <b>Right</b>, and
    <b>Top</b> entry areas.  These are coordinates, in microns, in the
    coordinate system of the top-level cell, <i>after</i> scaling is
    applied.  Only geometry that overlaps the window area will be
    included in the file.  However, when viewing the new file,
    geometry in subcells that also exist outside of the window area
    will be visible, unless the hierarchy is flattened.

    <p>
    If the <b>Clip to Window</b> button is active in addition to the
    <b>Use Window</b> button, objects will be clipped to the given
    window.  Without clipping, the entire object is retained.  With
    clipping, the objects will be clipped to the window given.  Again,
    unless the hierarchy is also flattened, geometry in subcells that
    also exist outside of the window will be displayed when viewing
    the new file.

    <p>
    When clipping, wires that require clipping are converted to
    polygons.

    <p>
    There are eight registers available for saving bounding-box
    parameters.  With the <b>S</b> (store) button, the current values
    in the four text entry areas that define the rectangle can be
    saved in one of the registers.  With the <b>R</b> (recall) button,
    the saved parameters can be retrieved into the text entry areas. 
    These registers are shared with other pop-ups that used windowing. 
    The 0 register is used by the <a href="xic:cut"><b>Cut and
    Export</b></a> command to save the rectangle defined with the mouse,
    the other registers are not directly used by any command.  The
    <b>Cut and Export</b> command can be used as a short-cut for
    entering rectangle data through user of register 0.  Press <b>Cut
    and Export</b> (in the <b>Convert Menu</b>), drag in a drawing
    window to define a rectangle, then press <b>Esc</b> to abort the
    command.  Then, recall register 0.

    <a name="flat"></a>
    <h2>Flattening</h2>

    <p>
    If the <b>Flatten Hierarchy</b> button is active, the output file
    will be a flat representation, i.e., all geometry will appear in
    the top-level cell, which will have no subcells.

    <a name="ecfilt"></a>
    <h2>Empty Cell Filtering</h2>

    Occasionally it is important or desirable to remove empty cells
    from output, particularly when <a href="layerchange">layer
    filtering</a> is employed.  Layer filtering can produce large
    numbers of empty cells.  A large number of empty cells will
    increase file size and may produce inefficiency in downstream
    processing operations.  Thus, provision for removing empty cells
    is available from the <b>Empty Cell Filter</b> check box group.

    <p>
    Empty cell filtering is recursive, in that it eliminates empty
    cells, and cells that contain only instances of empty cells. 
    There are two empty cell filtering operations available.

    <ol>
    <li>The <b>pre-filter</b> uses in-memory per-layer/per-cell
    statistics gathered during Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) creation to
    identify cells that should be excluded due to layer filtering. 
    This has relatively low overhead.  The CHD in use must have been
    <a href="xic:chdadd">created</a> with <b>per-cell and per-layer
    counts</b> specified, or this filtering is skipped.  If a CHD is
    implicitly created in processing, i.e., the user is not using a
    named CHD from the <a href="xic:hier"><b>Cell Hierarchy
    Digests</b></a> panel, then these counts will be saved
    automatically.

    <p>
    This filtering operation is performed entirely in memory and is
    typically very fast.  However, it identifies only cells that are
    made empty due to layer filtering.

    <p>
    <li>The <b>post-filter</b> identifies empty cells by reading the
    source layout file.  This can be rather time consuming, but
    applies whether or not layer filtering is being used, and will
    identify all empty cells.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The two check boxes separately enable each of these empty cell
    filtering operations.  If one doesn't care about empty cells,
    neither box should be checked.  If one is using layer filtering
    and just wants a quick pass to remove cells made empty due to
    layer filtering, <b>pre-filter</b> should be checked.  If one
    wants to remove all empty cells, both <b>pre-filter</b> and
    <b>post-filter</b> should be checked.  This will generally provide
    the fastest operation.  If not using layer filtering, this will be
    equivalent to checking <b>post-filter</b> only.  When using layer
    filtering, enabling both filters can be much faster that using
    post-filtering only.
!!LATEX windowing xiConvert.hlp>>
The windowing module is available in the {\cb Format Conversion} panel
and elsewhere, though not all features are available in some contexts. 
The module controls whether windowing and/or flattening is done when
layout data are being processed.

\subsubsection{Windowing}
\index{windowing}

The {\cb Use Window} button controls whether or not a rectangular area
is to be used.  If this button is set, only the objects that intersect
this area will appear in the output.  For subcells, only the objects
that appear within the window for some instance will be converted in
the corresponding cell.  The rectangular area can be set with the {\cb
Left}, {\cb Bottom}, {\cb Right}, and {\cb Top} entry areas.  These
are coordinates, in microns, in the coordinate system of the top-level
cell, {\it after} scaling is applied.  Only geometry that overlaps the
window area will be included in the file.  However, when viewing the
new file, geometry in subcells that also exist outside of the window
area will be visible, unless the hierarchy is flattened.

If the {\cb Clip to Window} button is active in addition to the {\cb
Use Window} button, objects will be clipped to the given window. 
Without clipping, the entire object is retained.  With clipping, the
objects will be clipped to the window given.  Again, unless the
hierarchy is also flattened, geometry in subcells that also exist
outside of the window will be displayed when viewing the new file.

When clipping, wires that require clipping are converted to polygons.

There are eight registers available for saving bounding-box
parameters.  With the {\cb S} (store) button, the current values in
the four text entry areas that define the rectangle can be saved in
one of the registers.  With the {\cb R} (recall) button, the saved
parameters can be retrieved into the text entry areas.  These
registers are shared with other pop-ups that used windowing.  The 0
register is used by the {\cb Cut and Export} command to save the
rectangle defined with the mouse, the other registers are not directly
used by any command.  The {\cb Cut and Export} command can be used as
a short-cut for entering rectangle data through user of register 0. 
Press {\cb Cut and Export} (in the {\cb Convert Menu}), drag in a
drawing window to define a rectangle, then press {\kb Esc} to abort
the command.  Then, recall register 0.

\subsubsection{Flattening}
\index{flattening}

If the {\cb Flatten Hierarchy} button is active, the output file will
be a flat representation, i.e., all geometry will appear in the
top-level cell, which will have no subcells.

\subsubsection{Empty Cell Filtering}

\label{ecfilt}

Occasionally it is important or desirable to remove empty cells from
output, particularly when layer filtering is employed.  Layer
filtering can produce large numbers of empty cells.  A large number of

Empty cell filtering is recursive, in that it eliminates empty cells,
and cells that contain only instances of empty cells.  There are two

\item{
The {\cb pre-filter} uses in-memory per-layer/per-cell

panel, then these counts will be saved automatically.

This filtering operation is performed entirely in memory and is
typically very fast.  However, it identifies only cells that are
made empty due to layer filtering. }

\item{
The {\cb post-filter} identifies empty cells by reading the source
layout file.  This can be rather time consuming, but applies whether
or not layer filtering is being used, and will identify all empty
cells. }
\end{enumerate}

The two check boxes separately enable each of these empty cell
filtering operations.  If one doesn't care about empty cells, neither
box should be checked.  If one is using layer filtering and just wants
a quick pass to remove cells made empty due to layer filtering, {\cb
pre-filter} should be checked.  If one wants to remove all empty
cells, both {\cb pre-filter} and {\cb post-filter} should be checked. 
This will generally provide the fastest operation.  If not using layer
filtering, this will be equivalent to checking {\cb post-filter} only. 
When using layer filtering, enabling both filters can be much faster
that using post-filtering only.

    The <b>Format Conversion</b> button in the <b>Convert Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Format Conversion</b> panel, which is a front end
    to a number of direct conversion functions which translate an
    input file into output of another (or the same) format.  These are
    direct conversions, i.e., the data are converted directly and do
    not enter the main <i>Xic</i> database.  This means that there are
    relaxed memory limitations, so almost arbitrarily large files can
    be translated.  It is also possible to perform scaling, data
    windowing or clipping, and hierarchy flattening while translating.

    <p>
    Conversions can also be performed by reading in a hierarchy and
    using the explicit output conversion in the <a
    href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel.

    <a name=format></a>
    <h2>File Format Selection</h2>

    <p>
    A drop-down menu at the top of the panel selects one of four
    types of input:
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Layout File</b><dd>
    The source file is a normal layout file in one of the supported <a
    href="xic:fsaf">archive formats</a>.  The various input file
    formats are recognized automatically.
    <p>
    <dt><b>Cell Hierarchy Digest Name</b><dd>
    Input will be read through a Cell Hierarchy Digest, as listed in
    the <a href="xic:hier"><b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b></a> panel.
    <p>
    <dt><b>Cell Hierarchy Digest File</b><dd>
    Input will be read through a Cell Hierarchy Digest found in a file
    on disk, as was generated from the <b>Save</b> button in the
    <b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b> panel.
    <p>
    <dt><b>Native Cell Directory</b><dd>
    Input will consist of native cell files found in a given
    directory.  All cells found in the directory that do not have a
    "<tt>.bak</tt>" file extension or duplicate a device library name,
    regardless of any hierarchical relationship or lack thereof, will
    be translated and concatenated into an archive file.
    </dl>

    <p>
    When translating CIF files, or from native cell files using
    <b>Native Cell Directory</b>, four-character CIF-style layer names
    found in the input must be mapped to layer and datatype numbers
    when output is in GDSII or OASIS format.  If the layer exists in
    the layer table and the GDSII <a
    href="StreamOut"><tt>StreamOut</tt></a> parameter has been set,
    that mapping will be used.  The <tt>StreamOut</tt> parameter is
    normally set in the technology file, but can also be set from the
    <a href="xic:lpedt"><b>Tech Parameter Editor</b></a> from the
    <b>Edit Tech Params</b> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>. 
    When not mapped via an existing layer in the layer table, if the
    CIF layer name is a four-digit hex number, it will be interpreted
    as "LLDD" to obtain the GDSII layer and datatype numbers.  If not
    in this form, a new layer number and datatype will be internally
    generated, using the <a
    href="UnknownGdsLayerBase"><b>UnknownGdsLayerBase</b></a> and <a
    href="UnknownGdsDatatype"><b>UnknownGdsDatatype</b></a> variables.

    <p>
    When using <b>Native Cell Directory</b>, the directory can contain
    an <a href="aliasfile">alias file</a> that can be used to map
    native cell names to new names in the output.  This file must be
    named "<tt>aliases.alias</tt>", and is never generated by
    <i>Xic</i>.  It must be prepared by hand or some other means if
    needed.  Each line contains the native cell name followed by the
    name to use in output, separated by white space.  The <b>Read
    Alias</b> check box in the <b>Format Conversion</b> panel, or
    (equivalently) the <a href="InUseAlias"><b>InUseAlias</b></a>
    variable must be set in order for the alias file to have effect.

    <p>
    The output format is selected through the tabs arrayed below the
    <b>Input Source</b> buttons.  Each tab, when selected, displays a
    page that may contain format-specific settings.  These pages are
    very similar to corresponding pages in the <a
    href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel, and the settings
    in the two panels track.  The <b>Format Conversion</b> panel
    provides some additional choices and options, however.  The
    differences are described below.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>GDSII</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert4.png" align=right>
    The output format is GDSII.  When the <b>Input Source</b> is set
    to <b>Layout File</b>, this page contains an <b>Input File
    Type</b> menu.  This menu contains two choices:  <b>archive</b>
    and <b>gds-text</b>.  The latter choice enables back-conversion to
    GDSII of the ASCII representation previously generated from a
    GDSII file using the <b>ASCII Text</b> output format tab.  The
    <b>archive</b> menu choice should be selected when reading normal
    layout data.

    <p>
    The header of a GDSII file optionally contains information about
    fonts, reference libraries, and other things.  This information is
    saved in a file named "<tt>gds_header_props</tt>" in the same
    directory as the output files, when converting to native files
    only.  The file is subsequently ignored by <i>Xic</i>, as this
    information is not used by <i>Xic</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>OASIS</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert5.png" align=right>
    The output format is OASIS.
    <br clear=all>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CIF</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert6.png" align=right>
    The output format is CIF.
    <br clear=all>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>CGX</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert7.png" align=right>
    The output format is CGX.

    <p>
    When translating to CGX format, the multi-box capability of BOX
    records in CGX is not used.  However, this feature is used when
    CGX files are written from memory.  Thus, reading a hierarchy into
    <i>Xic</i> and writing out a CGX file will probably result in a
    smaller CGX file than using the direct conversion.
    <br clear=all>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>XIC Cell Files</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert8.png" align=right>
    The output will be written to a family of native-format cell files.

    <p>
    When the selected output format is <b>Xic Cell Files</b>, the
    input will be converted to a number of native cell files, one
    for each cell defined in the input.  The same result can be
    obtained by reading the input file into the database with the <a
    href="xic:open"><b>Open</b></a> command, and then using the <a
    href="xic:exprt#toxic"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel to
    generate the <i>Xic</i> files.
    <br clear=all>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>ASCII Text</b><dd>
    <img src="screenshots/convert9.png" align=right>
    The output will be converted to an <a href="gdstext">ASCII
    text</a> representation of the input file format, for GDSII,
    OASIS, and CGX input.  This may be useful for debugging
    problematic layout files.  The ASCII text format produced for
    GDSII can be back-converted to GDSII through use of the
    <b>gds-text</b> selection in the <b>Input File Type</b> menu of
    the <b>GDSII</b> page.  The ASCII representation of OASIS files
    can be back-converted to OASIS with tools available from Anuvad. 
    The two check boxes that appear on this page apply when
    translating OASIS:

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>OASIS text: print offsets</b><dd>
    This sets/unsets the state of the <a
    href="OasPrintOffset"><b>OasPrintOffset</b></a> variable, and when
    active the first token of each printed record contains the offset
    in the file or containing CBLOCK record.  When not active, offsets
    are not printed.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>OASIS text: no line wrap</b><dd>
    This sets/unsets the state of the <a
    href="OasPrintNoWrap"><b>OasPrintNoWrap</b></a> variable,
    suppressing line breaking when active.  In this case, each record
    will use a single (possibly very long) line.  When not set, lines
    are broken and indented.
    </dl>
    </dl>

    <p>
    Note that the <b>Input Source</b> choice will affect the
    availability of output format tabs, in particular if other than
    <b>Layout File</b> is selected, the available tabs are
    <b>GDSII</b>, <b>OASIS</b>, <b>CIF</b>, <b>CGX</b>.

    <p>
    Below the output format selection tabs, there are two tabs which
    alter the lower half of the panel.  The <b>Setup</b> page provides
    some format-independent settings.  The <b>Convert File</b> page
    provides the button to actually start the process.

    <a name="setup"></a>
    <h2>The Setup Page</h2>
    <img src="screenshots/convert2.png" align=right>

    This page contains a number of check boxes which apply during
    format conversion.  These options are described below.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Strip For Export</b><dd>
    When the <b>Strip For Export</b> button is active, converted
    output will contain physical data only, and will contain no
    <i>Xic</i> extensions.  Further, the <b>Strip For Export</b> check
    box implicitly enables the same functionality as <b>Include
    library cell masters</b> (see below), so that the file will not contain
    unresolved library cell references.  Additionally, parameterized
    cell and standard via sub-masters will be included in output, as
    if the corresponding check boxes were also checked.  The <b>Strip
    For Export</b> box should be checked when creating a file for use
    in generating photomasks.  Note that the electrical information
    can never be recovered from a stripped file.

    <p>
    This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable <a
    href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> with the
    <b>!set</b> command.  The variable tracks the state of the check box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include library cell masters</b><dd>
    If the input references library cells (which have the LIBRARY <a
    href="xic:cells#flags">flag</a> set) whose masters are not found
    in the file, then these masters are not written to output unless
    this box is checked.  With the box not checked, the output file
    will require the referenced library be preesent and open when the
    file is read into <i>Xic</i> (the same requirement as the input
    file).  With the box checked, the masters are written to the
    output file, which will therefor not need the library.

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the <a
    href="KeepLibMasters"><b>KeepLibMasters</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include parameterized cell sub-masters</b><dd>
    When this check box is checked, output saved to disk files will
    include <a href="xic:pcells">sub-master</a> cells.  Ordinarily,
    sub-master cells are not included, as they will be re-created when
    the file is read.  However, when exporting to a system that does
    not support the pcells in use, the sub-masters must be written if
    the file is to have any value.  With the sub-masters present, the
    cells/instances will look like normal cell placements.

    <p>
    This applies when writing all output, <b>except</b> when using the
    <a href="xic:sv"><b>Save</b></a> and <a href="xic:save"><b>Save
    As</b></a> buttons in the <b>File Menu</b>, and the equivalent
    text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting the
    program.  It is also ignored when using the <a
    href="Save"><tt>Save</tt></a> script function.

!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> native pcells are only supported in <i>Xic</i>. 
    OpenAccess-based pcells might be supported by other systems, that
    is certainly the intent of the Ciranova PyCells.  Even if another
    system supports the OpenAccess PyCells, it may not have the logic
    to rebuild the pcells coming from a GDSII or other file source. 
    In that case one will probably have to ship the OpenAccess library
    files.
!!ENDIF

    <p>
    The <a href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> variable
    and the equivalent check box will have the same effect when set.

    <p>
    The <a href="PCellKeepSubMasters"><b>PCellKeepSubMasters</b></a>
    variable tracks the state of this check box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include standard via cell sub-masters</b><dd>
    When checked, <a href="stdvia">standard via</a> cell sub-masters
    are included in the output file.  This will be required when
    sending output to another system, as this implementation is
    specific to <i>Xic</i>.
!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    An exception may be systems that share an OpenAccess database
    with <i>Xic</i>.  If the cells are written to the OpenAccess
    database, the standard vias should translate properly, and be
    recognized by other tools (e.g., Virtuoso) that share the
    database.
!!ENDIF

    <p>
    This applies when writing all output, <b>except</b> when using the
    <a href="xic:sv"><b>Save</b></a> and <a href="xic:save"><b>Save
    As</b></a> buttons in the <b>File Menu</b>, and the equivalent
    text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting the
    program.  It is also ignored when using the <a
    href="Save"><tt>Save</tt></a> script function.

    <p>
    The <a href="StripForExport"><b>StripForExport</b></a> variable
    and the equivalent check box will have the same effect when set.

    <p>
    The <a href="ViaKeepSubMasters"><b>ViaKeepSubMasters</b></a>
    variable tracks the state of this check box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instance at top
    level</b><dd>
    This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
    set, instances of standard vias are retained as such, rather than
    being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the state of the
    <a href="NoFlattenStdVias"><b>NoFlattenStdVias</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Don't flatten pcells, keep as instance at top level</b><dd>
    This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy. 
    When set, instances of parameterized cells (pcells) are retained
    as such, rather than being written as geometry.  This check box
    tracks the state of the <a
    href="NoFlattenPCells"><b>NoFlattenPCells</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Ignore labels in subcells when flattening</b><dd>
    When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked
    labels found in subcells are ignored, meaning not reparented to
    the top level.  Pre-existing labels at the top level are not
    affected.  This is intended to prevent net name labels from
    subcells conflicting with net name labels defined at higher
    hierarchy levels.  The check box state tracks the <a
    href="NoFlattenLabels"><b>NoFlattenLabels</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Skip reading text labels from physical archives</b><dd>
    When set, text labels will not be read from a layout file when
    reading physical-mode data.  It is not generally advisable to use
    this, as text labels, though not physical objects, should be
    assumed to be present for a purpose.  However, this check box
    gives the user the flexibility to strip these out.  This check box
    tracks the status of the <a
    href="NoReadLabels"><b>NoReadLabels</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, text labels are included when the bounding box of a
    cell is computed.  If a text label actually determines the
    boundary of a cell, the bounding box of the cell may report
    differently from other tools.  The effective size of a text label
    is not well defined, and other tools will probably make different
    assumptions about font size, etc., or may not include text labels
    in bounding box computations.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Keep bad output (for debugging)</b><dd>
    When generating an archive file and an error occurs.  the archive
    file will normally be deleted.  However, if this box is checked,
    the output file will be given a "<tt>.BAD</tt>" extension and
    retained.  This file should be considered corrupt, but may be
    useful for diagnostics.  This tracks the state of the <a
    href="KeepBadArchive"><b>KeepBadArchive</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <h2>The Convert File Page</h2>
    <img src="screenshots/convert3.png" align=right>

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Layer Modification</b><dd>
    The <a href="layerchange">layer change module</a> allows layer
    filtering and/or mapping to be applied during the conversion operation.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Cell Name Mapping</b><dd>
    The <b>Cell Name Mapping</b> group of controls manages the cell
    name <a href="cellname">aliasing</a> feature.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Windowing and Flattening</b><dd>
    The <a href="windowing">windowing and flattening</a> group can be
    used to set up area filtering or hierarchy flattening.  These may
    not all be available for every input/output format permutation. 
    For example, the windowing operations are not available when the
    input format is <b>Native Cell Directory</b>.

    <p>
    If windowing, flattening, or empty cell filtering is set, only
    physical data are converted, i.e., there will be no electrical
    data in the resulting file.

    <p>
    <a name="region"></a>
    When windowing is in use and not flattening, an area filtering
    operation is applied to subcells.  For each subcell, a bounding
    box is obtained that contains all of the intersection areas of
    instances of the subcell that overlap the window area, in the
    space of the subcell master.  If there is no such overlap area,
    the subcell will not appear in output.  Otherwise, only objects
    within the subcell that overlap this bounding box will appear in
    output.  If clipping is enabled, the overlapping objects will be
    clipped to the bounding box boundary.

    <p>
    <img src="write_region.gif"><br>

    <p>
    In the figure, the two instances of A together "cover" all the
    objects shown in A.  All of these objects will therefor appear in
    A in output as shown, whether or not clipping is enabled.  They
    appear outside of the window boundary, illustrating that the
    window boundary is not absolute, unless flattening and clipping
    are employed.

    <p>
    In the single instance of B, the object shown straddles the window
    area and will therefor be included in output.  If clipping is
    enabled, the object within B will be clipped to the window
    boundary.  The single instance of C overlaps the window area, so
    will be included in output.  However, since none of its objects
    appear within the area, the C subcell will be empty in output. 
    Empty cells will be removed from output if the empty cell
    filtering option is set.  This will add some computational
    overhead, and in most cases empty cells are "harmless".
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Conversion Scale Factor</b><dd>
    For input file types that support scaling, the conversion scale
    factor entry area will be active.  A scale factor of .001 - 1000.0
    can be entered in this area, and will be applied during the
    translation.  When scaling, only the physical (not electrical)
    data are scaled.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Convert</b><dd>
    The translation is initiated with the <b>Convert</b> button.  The
    user will be prompted for the name of the input file (or directory
    if <b>Native Cell Directory</b>), and then the name of the output
    file, or directory for native files.

    <p>
    When the input source is a CHD or saved CHD file, when the user is
    prompted for the CHD name or file name, the user can supply an
    optional second argument.  This is the name of a cell in the CHD
    (including any aliasing applied when the CHD was created) that
    will be used as the root cell in output.  If no cell name is
    provided, the top-cell <a href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> in
    the CHD will be used.  If no cell is configured, all cells
    referenced in the CHD will be converted. 

    <p>
    If the input file contains multiple top-level cells, and no
    windowing, flattening, or empty cell filtering is employed, files
    are simply streamed through the converter and all cells are
    translated, using the specified parameters.  If windowing or
    similar is employed, a temporary Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) is
    transiently produced in memory, which is used to perform the
    conversion.  In this case, only the "default" top level cell
    hierarchy will be converted.  This is the first cell in the file
    that is not used as a subcell by another cell defined in the file. 
    Of course, if the input format choice is a <a
    href="xic:hier">CHD</a>, and the CHD is <a
    href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> with a top-level cell, that
    cell will be used.
    </dl>
!!LATEX xic:convt cvrtmenu.tex
The {\cb Format Conversion} button in the {\cb Convert Menu} brings up
the {\cb Format Conversion} panel, which is a front end to a number of
direct conversion functions which translate an input file into output
of another (or the same) format.  These are direct conversions, i.e.,
the data are converted directly and do not enter the main {\Xic}
database.  This means that there are relaxed memory limitations, so
almost arbitrarily large files can be translated.  It is also possible
to perform scaling, data windowing or clipping, and hierarchy
flattening while translating.

Conversions can also be performed by reading in a hierarchy and using
the explicit output conversion in the {\cb Export Control} panel.

\subsection{File Format Selection}

A drop-down menu at the top of the panel selects one of four
types of input:
\begin{description}
\item{\cb Layout File}\\
The source file is a normal layout file in one of the supported
archive formats.  The various input file formats are recognized
automatically.

\item{\cb Cell Hierarchy Digest Name}\\
Input will be read through a Cell Hierarchy Digest, as listed in the
{\cb Cell Hierarchy Digests} panel.

\item{\cb Cell Hierarchy Digest File}\\
Input will be read through a Cell Hierarchy Digest found in a file on
disk, as was generated from the {\cb Save} button in the {\cb Cell
Hierarchy Digests} panel.

\item{\cb Native Cell Directory File}\\
Input will consist of native cell files found in a given directory. 
All cells found in the directory that do not have a ``{\vt .bak}''
file extension or duplicate a device library name, regardless of any
hierarchical relationship or lack thereof, will be translated and
concatenated into an archive file.
\end{description}

When translating CIF files, or from native cell files using {\cb
Native Cell Directory}, four-character CIF-style layer names found in
the input must be mapped to layer and datatype numbers when output is
in GDSII or OASIS format.  If the layer exists in the layer table and
the GDSII {\vt StreamOut} parameter has been set, that mapping will be
used.  The {\vt StreamOut} parameter is normally set in the technology
file, but can also be set from the {\cb Tech Parameter Editor} from
the {\cb Edit Tech Params} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu}.  When
not mapped via an existing layer in the layer table, if the CIF layer
name is a four-digit hex number, it will be interpreted as ``LLDD'' to
obtain the GDSII layer and datatype numbers.  If not in this form, a
new layer number and datatype will be internally generated, using the
{\et UnknownGdsLayerBase} and {\et UnknownGdsDatatype} variables.

When using {\cb Native Cell Directory}, the directory can contain an
alias file (see \ref{aliasfile}) that can be used to map native cell
names to new names in the output.  This file must be named ``{\vt
aliases.alias}'', and is never generated by {\Xic}.  It must be
prepared by hand or some other means if needed.  Each line contains
the native cell name followed by the name to use in output, separated
by white space.  The {\cb Read Alias} check box in the {\cb Format
Conversion} panel, or (equivalently) the {\cb InUseAlias} variable
must be set in order for the alias file to have effect.

The output format is selected through the tabs arrayed below the {\cb
Input Source} buttons.  Each tab, when selected, displays a page that
may contain format-specific settings.  These pages are very similar to
corresponding pages in the {\cb Export Control} panel, and the
settings in the two panels track.  The {\cb Format Conversion} panel
provides some additional choices and options, however.  The
differences are described below.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb GDSII}\\
The output format is GDSII.  When the {\cb Input Source} is set to
{\cb Layout File}, this page contains an {\cb Input File Type} menu. 
This menu contains two choices:  {\cb archive} and {\cb gds-text}. 
The latter choice enables back-conversion to GDSII of the ASCII
representation previously generated from a GDSII file using the {\cb
ASCII Text} output format tab.  The {\cb archive} menu choice should
be selected when reading normal layout data.

The header of a GDSII file optionally contains information about
fonts, reference libraries, and other things.  This information is
saved in a file named ``{\vt gds\_header\_props}'' in the same
directory as the output files, when converting to native files only. 
The file is subsequently ignored by {\Xic}, as this information is not
used by {\Xic}.

\item{\cb OASIS}\\
The output format is OASIS.

\item{\cb CIF}\\
The output format is CIF.

\item{\cb CGX}\\
The output format is CGX.

When translating to CGX format, the multi-box capability of BOX
records in CGX is not used.  However, this feature is used when CGX
files are written from memory.  Thus, reading a hierarchy into {\Xic}
and writing out a CGX file will probably result in a smaller CGX file
than using the direct conversion.

\item{\cb XIC Cell Files}\\
The output will be written to a family of native-format cell files.

When the selected output format is {\cb Xic Cell Files}, the input
will be converted to a number of native cell files, one for each
cell defined in the input.  The same result can be obtained by reading
the input file into the database with the {\cb Open} command, and then
using the {\cb Export Control} panel to generate the {\Xic} files.

\item{\cb ASCII Text}\\
The output will be converted to an ASCII text representation of the
input file format, for GDSII, OASIS, and CGX input.  This may be
useful for debugging problematic layout files.  The ASCII text format
produced for GDSII can be back-converted to GDSII through use of the
{\cb gds-text} selection in the {\cb Input File Type} menu of the {\cb
GDSII} page.  The ASCII representation of OASIS files can be
back-converted to OASIS with tools available from Anuvad.  The two
check boxes that appear on this page apply when translating OASIS:

\begin{description}
\item{\cb OASIS text: print offsets}\\
This sets/unsets the state of the {\et OasPrintOffset} variable, and
when active the first token of each printed record contains the offset
in the file or containing CBLOCK record.  When not active, offsets are
not printed.

\item{\cb OASIS text: no line wrap}\\
This sets/unsets the state of the {\et OasPrintNoWrap} variable,
suppressing line breaking when active.  In this case, each record will
use a single (possibly very long) line.  When not set, lines are
broken and indented.
\end{description}
\end{description}

Note that the {\cb Input Source} choice will affect the availability
of output format tabs, in particular if other than {\cb Layout File}
is selected, the available tabs are {\cb GDSII}, {\cb OASIS}, {\cb
CIF}, {\cb CGX}.

Below the output format selection tabs, there are two tabs which alter
the lower half of the panel.  The {\cb Setup} page provides some
format-independent settings.  The {\cb Convert File} page provides the
button to actually start the process.

\subsection{The Setup Page}

This page contains a number of check boxes which apply during format
conversion.  These options are described below.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Strip For Export}\\
When the {\cb Strip For Export} button is active, converted output
will contain physical data only, and all masters, and will contain no
{\Xic} extensions.  The {\cb Strip For Export} box should be checked
when creating an export file for use in generating photomasks.  Note
that the electrical information can never be recovered from a stripped
file.  The check box tracks the state of the {\et StripForExport}
variable.

This mode can also be enabled by setting the boolean variable {\et
StripForExport} with the {\cb !set} command.  The variable tracks the
state of the check box.

\item{\cb Include library cell masters}\\
If the input file references library cells (which have the LIBRARY
flag set) whose masters are not found in the file, then these masters
are not written to output unless this box is checked.  With the box
not checked, the output file will require the referenced library be
preesent and open when the file is read into {\Xic} (the same
requirement as the input file).  With the box checked, the masters are
written to the output file, which will therefor not need the library.

This tracks the state of the {\et KeepLibMasters} variable.

\item{\cb Include parameterized cell sub-masters}\\
When this check box is checked, output saved to disk files will
include sub-master cells.  Ordinarily, sub-master cells are not
included, as they will be re-created when the file is read.  However,
when exporting to a system that does not support the pcells in use,
the sub-masters must be written if the file is to have any value. 
With the sub-masters present, the cells/instances will look like
normal cell placements.

This applies when writing all output, {\bf except} when using the {\cb
Save} and {\cb Save As} buttons in the {\cb File Menu}, and the
equivalent text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting
the program.  It is also ignored when using the {\vt Save} script
function.

%\ifoa
{\Xic} native pcells are only supported in {\Xic}.  OpenAccess-based
pcells might be supported by other systems, that is certainly the
intent of the Ciranova PyCells.  Even if another system supports the
OpenAccess PyCells, it may not have the logic to rebuild the pcells
coming from a GDSII or other file source.  In that case one will
probably have to ship the OpenAccess library files.
%\fi

The {\et StripForExport} variable and the equivalent check box will
have the same effect when set.

The {\et PCellKeepSubMasters} variable tracks the state of this check
box.

\item{\cb Include standard via cell sub-masters}\\
When checked, standard via cell sub-masters are included in the output
file.  This will be required when sending output to another system, as
this implementation is specific to {\Xic}.
%\ifoa
An exception may be systems that share an OpenAccess database with
{\Xic}.  If the cells are written to the OpenAccess database, the
standard vias should translate properly, and be recognized by other
tools (e.g., Virtuoso) that share the database.
%\fi

This applies when writing all output, {\bf except} when using the {\cb
Save} and {\cb Save As} buttons in the {\cb File Menu}, and the
equivalent text accelerators and including the prompts when exiting
the program.  It is also ignored when using the {\vt Save} script
function.

The {\et StripForExport} variable and the equivalent check box will
have the same effect when set.

The {\et ViaKeepSubMasters} variable tracks the state of this check
box.

\item{\cb Don't flatten standard vias, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of standard vias are retained as such, rather than
being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the state of the
{\et NoFlattenStdVias} variable.

\item{\cb Don't flatten pcells, keep as instance at top level}\\
This mode may apply when flattening a physical cell hierarchy.  When
set, instances of parameterized cells (pcells) are retained as such,
rather than being written as geometry.  This check box tracks the
state of the {\et NoFlattenPCells} variable.

\item{\cb Ignore labels in subcells when flattening}\\
When flattening a cell hierarchy, if this check box is checked labels
found in subcells are ignored, meaning not reparented to the top
level.  Pre-existing labels at the top level are not affected.  This
is intended to prevent net name labels from subcells conflicting with
net name labels defined at higher hierarchy levels.  The check box
state tracks the {\et NoFlattenLabels} variable.

\item{\cb Skip reading text labels from physical archives}\\
When set, text labels will not be read from a layout file when reading
physical-mode data.  It is not generally advisable to use this, as
text labels, though not physical objects, should be assumed to be
present for a purpose.  However, this check box gives the user the
flexibility to strip these out.  This check box tracks the status of
the {\et NoReadLabels} variable.

In {\Xic}, text labels are included when the bounding box of a cell is
computed.  If a text label actually determines the boundary of a cell,
the bounding box of the cell may report differently from other tools. 
The effective size of a text label is not well defined, and other
tools will probably make different assumptions about font size, etc.,
or may not include text labels in bounding box computations.

\item{\cb Keep bad output (for debugging)}\\
When generating an archive file and an error occurs.  the archive file
will normally be deleted.  However, if this box is checked, the output
file will be given a ``{\vt .BAD}'' extension and retained.  This file
should be considered corrupt, but may be useful for diagnostics.  This
tracks the state of the {\et KeepBadArchive} variable.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Convert File Page}

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Layer Modification}\\
The layer change module allows layer filtering and/or mapping to be
applied during the conversion operation.

\item{\cb Cell Name Mapping}\\
The {\cb Cell Name Mapping} group of controls manages the cell
name aliasing feature.

\item{\cb Windowing and Flattening}\\
The windowing and flattening group can be used to set up area
filtering or hierarchy flattening.  These may not all be available for
every input/output format permutation.  For example, the windowing
operations are not available when the input format is {\cb Native Cell
Directory}.

If windowing, flattening, or empty cell filtering is set, only
physical data are converted, i.e., there will be no electrical data in
the resulting file.

When windowing is in use and not flattening, an area filtering
operation is applied to subcells.  For each subcell, a bounding box is
obtained that contains all of the intersection areas of instances of
the subcell that overlap the window area, in the space of the subcell
master.  If there is no such overlap area, the subcell will not appear
in output.  Otherwise, only objects within the subcell that overlap
this bounding box will appear in output.  If clipping is enabled, the
overlapping objects will be clipped to the bounding box boundary.

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{writeregion} Illustration of windowing applied over
subcell instances.}
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{center}
\epsfbox{images/write_region.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{writeregion}, the two instances of A together ``cover''
all the objects shown in A.  All of these objects will therefor appear
in A in output as shown, whether or not clipping is enabled.  They
appear outside of the window boundary, illustrating that the window
boundary is not absolute, unless flattening and clipping are employed.

In the single instance of B, the object shown straddles the window
area and will therefor be included in output.  If clipping is enabled,
the object within B will be clipped to the window boundary.  The
single instance of C overlaps the window area, so will be included in
output.  However, since none of its objects appear within the area,
the C subcell will be empty in output.  Empty cells will be removed
from output if the empty cell filtering option is set.  This will add
some computational overhead, and in most cases empty cells are
``harmless''.

\item{\cb Conversion Scale Factor}\\
For input file types that support scaling, the conversion scale factor
entry area will be active.  A scale factor of .001 -- 1000.0 can be
entered in this area, and will be applied during the translation. 
When scaling, only the physical (not electrical) data are scaled.

\item{\cb Convert}\\
The translation is initiated with the {\cb Convert} button.  The user
will be prompted for the name of the input file (or directory for {\cb
Native Cell Directory}, and then the name of the output file, or
directory for native files.

When the input source is a CHD or saved CHD file, when the user is
prompted for the CHD name or file name, the user can supply an
optional second argument.  This is the name of a cell in the CHD
(including any aliasing applied when the CHD was created) that will be
used as the root cell in output.  If no cell name is provided, the
top-cell configured in the CHD will be used.  If no cell is
configured, all cells referenced in the CHD will be converted.

If the input file contains multiple top-level cells, and no windowing,
flattening, or empty cell filtering is employed, files are simply
streamed through the converter and all cells are translated, using the
specified parameters.  If windowing or similar is employed, a
temporary Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) is transiently produced in
memory, which is used to perform the conversion.  In this case, only
the ``default'' top level cell hierarchy will be converted.  This is
the first cell in the file that is not used as a subcell by another
cell defined in the file.  Of course, if the input format choice is a
CHD, and the CHD is configured with a top-level cell, that cell will
be used.

Generating ASCII output from layout data

    The conversion of GDSII to "gds-text" is a diagnostic tool for
    converting the data in a (binary) GDSII file into a text form. 
    Each record of the stream file is parsed and output generated in
    sequence.  The text file can grow quite large, though a range
    specification can be given to limit the number of records printed. 
    The text file is mainly used as a diagnostic for misbehaving GDSII
    files.  It can be reconverted into a GDSII file, thus, the text
    representation is in effect another valid file format for
    layout data.  This facility allows corrupted or otherwise
    problematic GDSII files to be repaired.

    <p>
    OASIS files converted to ASCII text use the same ASCII record
    format as <tt>anuvad-0.2</tt> from <b>SoftJin</b> (<a
    href="http://www.softjin.com/html/anuvad.htm">
    http://www.softjin.com/html/anuvad.htm</a>), except for the

    records.  The <tt>anuvad</tt> tool set is free, and contains
    libraries and programs to convert between GDSII and OASIS formats,
    and to/from ASCII text representations of those formats.  The
    boolean variable <a
    href="OasPrintNoWrap"><b>OasPrintNoWrap</b></a> will suppress line
    wrapping when set, i.e., each record will occupy one possibly very
    long text line.  The boolean variable <a
    href="OasPrintOffset"><b>OasPrintOffset</b></a> will add file
    offsets to the output when set.  These variables track the
    settings of the check boxes on the <b>ASCII text</b> output format
    tab page in the <a href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a>
    panel.

    <p>
    When converting to text format, the user will be prompted for an
    optional range specification string.  If no string is given, the
    entire archive file will be written as text.  The range
    specification string is expected to be in the following format.

    <blockquote>
    [<i>start_offs</i>[<tt>-</tt><i>end_offs</i>]] [<tt>-r</tt>
      <i>rec_count</i>] [<tt>-c</tt> <i>cell_count</i>]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The square brackets indicate optional terms.  The meanings are:

    <dl>
    <dt><i>start_offs</i><dd>
    An integer, in decimal or "<tt>0x</tt>" hex format (a hex digit
    preceded by "<tt>0x</tt>").  The printing will begin at the first
    record with offset greater than or equal to this value.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>end_offs</i><dd>
    An integer in decimal or "<tt>0x</tt>" hex format.  If this value
    is greater than <i>start_offs</i>, the last record printed is at
    most the one containing this offset.  If given, this should appear
    after a '-' character following the <i>start_offs</i>, with no
    space.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>rec_count</i><dd>
    A positive integer, at most this many records will be printed.

    A non-negative integer, at most the records for this many cell
    definitions will be printed.  If given as 0, the records from the

    </dl>

    <p>
    Records are printed from the beginning of the file, or the

    <p>
    The <b>Layout File Merge Tool</b>, brought up with the
    <b>Assemble</b> button in the <b>Convert Menu</b>, will extract
    cell hierarchies from one or more layout files, optionally perform
    some processing, then add the hierarchies to a single output file. 
    It is essentially a graphical front-end for the <a
    href="!assemble"><b>!assemble</b></a> command.  The tool is
    intended to be highly flexible.  Potential applications include
    building up reticles for mask generation or combining design
    output from different development groups into a single file.

    <p>
    Similar operations can be performed by use of <a
    href="refcell">reference cells</a>.

    <p>
    The supported layout <a href="xic:fsaf">file formats</a> for input
    and output are GDSII, CGX, OASIS, and CIF.  The file format is
    specified when writing, and is determined automatically when
    reading.  Any combination of these formats can be used for input
    and output.

    <p>
    The data read from the input files can be processed in various
    ways before writing to output.  Some of these operations are
    sketched below.

    <br clear=all>
    <ul>
    <li>The layers can be filtered, to exclude certain layers, accept
    only certain layers, or to map certain layers to another layer. 
    For GDSII and OASIS, the "layer" is actually a layer
    number/datatype number combination.  Specification of a layer
    includes wildcarding of the layer or datatype number.

    <li>The names of cells can be modified to add or replace a prefix
    and/or suffix.

    <li>The data can be transformed by scaling, rotation, translation,
    and mirroring before placement in the output.

    <li>The data can be filtered to objects that overlay a rectangular
    window, and may be clipped to the window.

    <li>The hierarchy can be flattened before placement.

    <li>Empty cells can be filtered out of the output.
    </ul>

    Any combination of these processing operations can be specified.

    <p>
    The processed hierarchies from the specified input layout files
    are generally placed in a new top-level cell created in the output
    file.  The user can choose the name of this cell, and if no
    name is given, no new top-level cell will be created, and the data
    from each input will simply be concatenated in the output.

    <p>
    During the merge, the tool remembers tha names of all cells seen,
    and will automatically change the names of cells that would clash
    in the combined file.  Notification of the change will be written
    to the log file, which is produced during a run.  The logfile is
    named "<tt>assemble.log</tt>" and is produced in the current
    directory.

    <a name="overview"></a>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    Along the top of the <b>Merge Tool</b> are tabs which make visible
    separate pages for output and input.  There will always be an
    output tab, and at least one source tab.  At startup, there is a
    single source tab, labeled "Source 1".  Each layout file from
    which files are to be extracted will have a source tab, and it is
    also possible to use the same archive file in different source
    pages if necessary.  A new source page can be created with the
    <b>New Source</b> button in the <a href="#optsmenu"><b>Options</b>
    menu</a>, and an existing source page can be deleted with the
    <b>Remove Source</b> button in the same menu. 

    <p>
    Each source page must be filled in with the appropriate entries
    before the merge run.  We will return to a description of the
    fields in the source pages.

    <p>
    The left-most tab is labeled <b>Output</b>, and when selected will
    show a page for configuring the overall job output.  The
    <b>Top-Level Cell Name</b> field may contain the name of a cell
    that will be created in the output file as a container for the
    cell hierarchies read from the sources.  This will be the
    top-level cell in the output file.  The name is arbitrary, but
    should conform to the standards of the output file format.  If it
    should clash with another cell being written from a source, that
    file name will be modified to avoid the clash.

    <p>
    It is also possible to run a merge without entering a <b>Top-Level
    Cell Name</b>.  In this case, the hierarchies extracted from the
    source archives are simply concatenated in the output file.  The
    output file may then have multiple top-level cells.  Any
    transformation information except scaling will be ignored, since
    transformations apply to the placement of the hierarchy in the
    container top-level cell.

    <p>
    The <b>Path to New Layout File</b> field is required; it specifies
    the output file.  The format of the output file produced is
    determined by the format tab selected at the top of the output
    page.

    <p>
    The <b>Create layout File</b> button initiates to merge operation. 
    It should be pressed when all relevant fields in the <b>Merge Tool</b>
    have been filled in.  Depending upon the number and size of the
    files and hardware characteristics, the operation can take seconds
    to hours.  When started, a progress monitor pop-up appears.  This
    displays the number of bytes read and written, error and warning
    messages emitted, and a "working" indication.  An abort button is
    also provided which can be used to terminate the operation.

    <p>
    The <b>Dismiss</b> button will exit the <b>Merge Tool</b> program. 
    Unless the <b>Save</b> button in the <a
    href="#filemenu"><b>File</b> menu</a> has been used, all entered
    information will be lost.  The <b>Save</b> button can be used to
    save the current state of the <b>Merge Tool</b> to a file, which
    can be read later (with the <b>Recall</b> button) to configure the
    <b>Merge Tool</b> to the same state as was saved.  The file format
    is that used as input to the <b>!assemble</b> command, and is
    described there.  Note that files prepared by hand for use with
    the <b>!assemble</b> command can be loaded into the <b>Merge
    Tool</b> with the <b>Recall</b> button.

    <img src="screenshots/assemble2.png" align=right>
    Each input file has at least one corresponding source page.  Only
    one page is visible, and it occupies the main part of the <b>Merge
    Tool</b> display.  The page displayed can be selected by clicking
    on the <b>Source</b> tabs just below the menu bar.  The entries in
    the page identify the cells to extract and the processing to be
    performed.

    <p>
    The required <b>Path to Source</b> field contains the path to the
    associated layout file, and the file must be in one of the <a
    href="xic:fsaf">supported formats</a>.  This entry can also be the
    access name of a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a>
    (CHD) in memory, or a path to a saved CHD file on disk.  In either
    case, the CHD will then be used to access the content of the
    associated file.

    <a name="lfilt"></a>
    <h4>Layer Filtering Module</h4>

    The group of entries below the file path controls layer filtering
    and aliasing.  These are optional and can be ignored if no layer
    manipulations are needed.

    <p>
    The module contains the following controls:
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Layer List</b> text area<dd>
    The <b>Layer List</b> can be set to a space-separated list of <a
    href="layername">layer names</a>.  Each layer name is expected to
    match an effective layer name in the file being read.  For file
    types such as GDSII that designate layers with layer/datatype
    integers, either the hex encoding or decimal form can be used,
    with wildcarding accepted.  The <b>Layer List</b> is ignored unless
    one of the following two check boxes is selected.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Layers Only</b> check box<dd>
    If this box is checked, only the layers listed in the <b>Layer
    List</b> will be read from the source.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Skip Layers</b> check box<dd>
    This box can be checked if the <b>Layers Only</b> box is
    unchecked.  When checked, layers listed in the <b>Layer List</b>
    will be ignored in the source.  All layers except those listed
    will be read.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Layer Aliases</b> text area<dd>
    This provides a means for converting layers found in input from the
    source to a different layer when written to output.  The entered text
    contains zero of more space-separated text tokens in the form
    <blockquote>
        <i>oldname</i>=<i>newname</i>
    </blockquote>
    The <i>oldname</i> is a layer name consistent with the source format.
    For GDSII and OASIS, either hex or decimal encoding is accepted.
    The <i>newname</i> is the destination layer consistent with the
    output format.  Again, gor GDSII and OASIS either the hex or
    decimal forms may be used.  There should be no space between
    the names (or in the names) and the equal sign '=' separator.
    </dl>

    <a name="scale"></a>
    <h4>Scaling</h4>

    There are three different scaling entries which may apply.  If
    there are no cells listed in the <b>Top-Level Cells</b> entry
    area, then none of the "per cell" settings (to be described)
    apply, and the value in the <b>Conversion Scale Factor</b> entry
    area will be used to scale all coordinates read from the source. 
    The <b>Conversion Scale Factor</b> will be ignored if any cells
    are listed in the <b>Top-Level Cells</b> area, and scaling values
    will be obtained from the "per cell" entries.

    <p>
    The "per cell" entries allow scaling of the cell definitions
    written to output, and magnification of any instantiations created
    in a top-level cell in output.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Conversion Scale Factor</b> numeric entry area<dd>
    This provides a scale factor for cell data read from the source
    when no <b>Top-Level Cells</b> have been given.  This value is
    ignored otherwise.  This can range from .001 through 1000.0, and
    is applied to all coordinates of cells being read from the present
    source.
    </dl>

    <a name="cname"></a>
    <h4>Cell Name Modification</h4>

    This group allows systematic changes to the cell names read from
    the source layout file.  If the source is a CHD, then the cell
    name modifications described here are performed after any cell
    modifications configured into the CHD.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Prefix</b> and <b>Suffix</b> text entries<dd>
    Text entered into these text areas will be added as a prefix or
    suffix to cell names encountered when reading the source file. 
    The entries are string tokens, containing any alphanumeric
    characters plus '$', '?', '_'.  String tokens given in this form
    will be prepended/appended to each cell name read from the source.

    <p>
    A limited text substitution mechanism is available.  The string
    tokens can also have the form /<i>str</i>/<i>sub</i>/ which
    indicates a substitution.  This causes the <i>str</i> if it
    appears as a prefix/suffix of a cell name to be replaced by
    <i>sub</i>.  The <i>sub</i> can be empty (i.e., the form is
    /<i>str</i>//) which can be used to undo the previous addition of
    a prefix or suffix.  Forms like //<i>sub</i>/ are equivalent to
    just giving <i>sub</i> as a string.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>To Lower</b> and <b>To Upper</b> check boxes<dd>
    If set, <b>To Lower</b> will convert upper case cell names to
    lower case, and <b>To Upper</b> will convert lower case cell names
    to upper.  Mixed case cell names are not affected.  Case
    conversion is performed before any applied prefix/suffix.
    </dl>

    <a name="clist"></a>
    <h4>Top-Level Cells List</h4>

    Each source may have one or more top-level cells specified.  If no
    top-level cells are specified the default operation will be as
    follows.  If the source is a layout file, the entire file will be
    streamed into the output.  If the source is a CHD, the cell
    hierarchy of the CHD's <a href="xic:chdconfig">default cell</a>
    will be streamed into the output.  If not explicitly configured,
    this will be the first top-level cell in the file referenced by
    the CHD.

    <p>
    The top-level cell names are names of cells in the source.  If the
    source is a CHD with cell name modification, the names must
    include the modification.  These cells, and possibly their
    hierarchies, will be used in output.  Note that the cells listed
    are not necessarily top-level in the source, any cell in the
    source file can be listed.

    <p>
    Cells are added to the list by use of the <b>New Toplevel</b>
    button in the <b>Options</b> menu.  Note that the user must
    generally know the names of the cells in the source to be
    extracted.  If an empty cell name is given at the prompt, the text
    "<tt>&#60;default></tt>" will appear in the listing, which will
    correspond to the default cell of a CHD source or the first
    top-level cell found in a source file.  Thus, it is possible to
    access the "top" cell in a source without knowing its name. 
    Giving a cell makes available the "per cell" operations in the
    <b>Basic</b> and <b>Advanced</b> pages to the right of the
    listing.

    <p>
    One can use the <b>Contents</b> list in the <a
    href="xic:hier"><b>Cell Hierarchy Digests</b></a> listing to list
    the cell names, if the source has a corresponding CHD.  Cell names
    can be dragged directly from the listing panel and dropped in the
    <b>Top-Level Cells</b> list, bypassing the need to use the <b>New
    Toplevel</b> menu button.

    <p>
    Clicking on a cell name in the list will select it, enabling
    additional "per cell" entries which apply to this cell and its
    hierarchy.  The selected cell name can be deleted from the list
    with the <b>Remove Toplevel</b> button in the <b>Options</b> menu.

    <a name="tform"></a>
    <h4>Basic Transformations</h4>

    If a cell name is selected in the <b>Top-Level Cells</b> listing,
    the entries in the <b>Basic</b> tab page become enabled.  One may
    have to click on the "Basic" tab to display the entries.  These
    control the transformation of the selected cell when instantiated
    in the top-level cell in the output file.  If there is no
    top-level cell name given, these entries will be ignored.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Placement Name</b> entries<dd>
    The <b>Placement Name</b> field can be filled in with a new name. 
    The selected cell will be saved under this name, rather than its
    real name, in output.  Any name modifications in force will be
    applied to this name.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Basic</b> transformation entries<dd>
    This tab page contains entries that control the transformation of
    the selected cell when instantiated.  The <b>Placement X,Y</b>
    entries set the translation coordinates in microns.  The origin of
    the selected cell will be mapped to this location in the output
    top-level cell.  Additionally, the cell instance can be rotated,
    mirrored, or magnified.  The <b>Rotation Angle</b> menu provides
    rotation angle choices:  multiples of 45 degrees.  The
    <b>Mirror-Y</b> button will invert the Y-coordinates before
    rotation.  The <b>Magnification</b> entry can change the scaling
    of the instantiation.
    </dl>

    <a name="adv"></a>
    <h4>Advanced Operations</h4>

    When a cell name is selected in the <b>Top-Level Cells</b>
    listing, the entries in the <b>Advanced</b> tab page become
    enabled.  These operations apply to the cell data read from the
    source file for the selected cell, allowing windowing, flattening,
    and other operations.  These are similar to the <a
    href="windowing">windowing</a> operations provided in the <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> panel.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Use Window</b> check box<dd>
    Windowing operations are enabled by setting the <b>Use Window</b>
    check box.  A window is a rectangular area in the selected cell,
    which is specified (in microns) with the four numerical entry
    boxes.

    <p>
    With windowing enabled, only objects and subcells that have
    nonzero overlap with the window will be written to output.  In
    subcells, only objects that overlap the window in the context of
    some instance will be included.  Thus, only the objects in the
    file needed to represent the window area of the selected cell to
    all depths below the selected cell will be read from the source.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Clip</b> check box<dd>
    If in addition the <b>Clip</b> check box is set, the objects will
    be clipped to the window.  This includes objects in subcells. 
    Note that this does not guarantee that geometry will not appear
    outside of the window, since instance geometry may appear anywhere.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Flatten</b> check box<dd>
    The <b>Flatten</b> button will flatten the hierarchy under the
    selected cell.  Flattening can be applied with or without
    windowing.  Along with windowing and clipping, no geometry will
    extend outside of the window area.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Empty Cell Filter</b><dd>
    The <b>pre-filt</b> and <b>post-filt</b> check boxes enable the
    two stages of empty cell filtering, as <a
    href="ecfilt">described</a> for the <b>Format Conversion</b> panel.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Scale Factor</b> entry<dd>
    The coordinates in the cell and its hierarchy will be scaled by
    this factor in output.  This is done logically before any
    windowing operations.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>No Hierarchy</b> check box<dd>
    If checked, only the cell, and not its subcell hierarchy, will be
    included in output.  This can lead to unresolved references in the
    output file.
    </dl>

    <a name="menus"></a>
    <h2>Merge Tool Menus</h2>

    The <b>Merge Tool</b> provides three drop-down menus in the menu
    bar at the top of the interactive display:  <b>File</b>,
    <b>Options</b>, and <b>Help</b>.  The <b>File</b> menu contains
    entries related to input/output, and <b>Options</b> contains
    entries for modification of program operation.  The <b>Help</b>
    menu provides access to documentation.  This section describes the
    entries of each menu in detail.

    <p>
    Some of the menu entries have keyboard accelerators, which are
    listed in the menu.  Pressing the accelerator key combination has
    the same effect as pressing the menu button, without the need to
    display the menu.
    
    <a name=filemenu></a>
    <h4>The File Menu</h4>

    The file menu contains command buttons that deal generally with
    input/output.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>File Select</b><dd>
    The <b>File Select</b> button brings up a <a href="filesel"><b>File
    Selection</b></a> panel.  This enables the file hierarchy on the
    user's computer to be searched for files.  Selecting a file by
    double clicking a name of pressing the green octagon "Go" button
    will enter the full file path into the <b>Path to Source</b>
    entry of the current <b>Source</b> page.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Save</b><dd>
    The <b>Save</b> button will save the current <b>Merge Tool</b>
    configuration in a file.  The file format is as described for the
    <a href="!assemble#input"><b>!assemble</b></a> command.  This
    includes all of the filled-in entries of all pages currently
    recorded in the tool.  This file can be subsequently read to reset
    the <b>Merge Tool</b> to the saved status.  The generated file is
    in a simple ASCII format that can be generated by third-party
    scripts, etc., by the advanced user.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Save</b> button will pop-up a small dialog asking
    for a name for the file.  This name can be anything, but it is
    recommended that a standard extension such as "<tt>.sav</tt>" be
    used to make these files easily recognized.  Pressing the <b>Save
    State</b> button on the dialog will generate and save the state
    file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Recall</b><dd>
    The <b>Recall</b> button will read a file previously saved with
    the <b>Save</b> button, and reconfigure the <b>Merge Tool</b> to
    the state saved in the <a href="!assemble#input">file</a>.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Recall</b> button will pop up a small dialog
    asking for the name of the file.  This can be entered directly, or
    the <b>File Selection</b> panel (from the <b>File Select</b>
    button) can be used to locate the file.  Once located, the name of
    the file can be dragged from the <b>File Selection</b> panel and
    dropped in the dialog.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Recall State</b> button in the dialog will
    reconfigure the <b>Merge Tool</b> to the state found in the file.  All
    entries in the tool should be as saved.
    </dl>

    <a name=optsmenu></a>
    <h4>The Options Menu</h4>

    The <b>Options</b> menu contains buttons that enable making
    certain entries into the <b>Merge Tool</b> forms, and otherwise
    induce changes in configuration.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Reset</b><dd>
    Pressing this button will reset the configuration of the <b>Merge
    Tool</b> to the startup (empty) configuration.  All existing
    entries will be lost.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>New Source</b><dd>
    Each input file from which cells are to be extracted, termed a
    "Source", has a separate page in the <b>Merge Tool</b> display.  At
    startup, there is one empty source page, which is specified as
    "Source 1" in the tab at the top of the display.  The <b>New
    Source</b> button will create a new empty source page, with a new
    tab with a unique name.  The new page will become the visible
    page.  Other source pages can be selected by clicking on the tabs.
    Each source page must be filled in with the appropriate entries
    before a merge can be performed.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Remove Source</b><dd>
    Pressing this button will irretrievably delete the currently visible
    source page, if it is not the initial "Source 1" page.  The page and
    its tab and contents will disappear.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>New Toplevel</b><dd>
    This will add the name of a top level cell to the <b>Top-Level
    Cells</b> list of the current page.  These are cells that
    represent the top level of hierarchies to be extracted from the
    archive file named in the <b>Path to Source</b> entry on the same
    page.  The names in the list must match an actual cell name found
    in the file.  These are "top-level" in the extraction sense and
    need not be top-level in the overall cell hierarchy of the file. 
    The list can contain the same name multiple times if multiple
    instances of the cell are needed in output.

    <p>
    Note that the user must have knowledge of the names of the cells
    used in the file.  The names specified must be the actual names
    found in the file, and do not reflect name changes that might be
    applied during processing.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Remove Toplevel</b><dd>
    This will remove the highlighted entry in the <b>Top-Level Cells</b>
    list, if an entry is highlighted.  An entry is highlighted by clicking
    on it with the mouse.  When an entry is removed, it will not appear
    in the output.
    </dl>

    <a name=helpmenu></a>
    <h4>The Help Menu</h4>

    The <b>Help</b> menu provides access to <b>Merge Tool</b> on-line
    documentation.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Help</b><dd>
    This brings up the help system.
    </dl>
!!LATEX xic:assem cvrtmenu.tex
The {\cb Layout File Merge Tool}, brought up with the {\cb Assemble}
button in the {\cb Convert Menu}, will extract cell hierarchies from
one or more layout files, optionally perform some processing, then add
the hierarchies to a single output file.  It is essentially a
graphical front-end for the {\cb !assemble} command.  The tool is
intended to be highly flexible.  Potential applications include
building up reticles for mask generation or combining design output
from different development groups into a single file.

Similar operations can be performed by use of reference cells.

The supported layout file formats for input and output are GDSII, CGX,
OASIS, and CIF.  The file format is specified when writing, and is
determined automatically when reading.  Any combination of these
formats can be used for input and output.

The data read from the input files can be processed in various ways
before writing to output.  Some of these operations are sketched
below.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The layers can be filtered, to exclude certain layers, accept
only certain layers, or to map certain layers to another layer.  For
GDSII and OASIS, the ``layer'' is actually a layer number/datatype
number combination.  Specification of a layer includes wildcarding of
the layer or datatype number.}

\item{The names of cells can be modified to add or replace a prefix
and/or suffix.}

\item{The data can be transformed by scaling, rotation, translation,
and mirroring before placement in the output.}

\item{The data can be filtered to objects that overlay a rectangular
window, and may be clipped to the window.}

\item{The hierarchy can be flattened before placement.}

\item{Empty cells can be filtered out of the output.}
\end{itemize}

Any combination of these processing operations can be specified.

The processed hierarchies from the specified input layout files are
generally placed in a new top-level cell created in the output file. 
The user can choose the name of this cell, and if no name is given, no
new top-level cell will be created, and the data from each input will
simply be concatenated in the output.

During the merge, the tool remembers tha names of all cells seen, and
will automatically change the names of cells that would clash in the
combined file.  Notification of the change will be written to the log
file, which is produced during a run.  The logfile is named ``{\vt
assemble.log}'' and is produced in the current directory.

\subsection{Overview}

Along the top of the {\cb Merge Tool} are tabs which make visible
separate pages for output and input.  There will always be an output
tab, and at least one source tab.  At startup, there is a single
source tab, labeled ``Source 1''.  Each layout file from which files
are to be extracted will have a source tab, and it is also possible to
use the same archive file in different source pages if necessary.  A
new source page can be created with the {\cb New Source} button in the
{\cb Options} menu, and an existing source page can be deleted with
the {\cb Remove Source} button in the same menu.

Each source page must be filled in with the appropriate entries before
the merge run.  We will return to a description of the fields in the
source pages.

The left-most tab is labeled {\cb Output}, and when selected will show
a page for configuring the overall job output.  The {\cb Top-Level
Cell Name} field may contain the name of a cell that will be created
in the output file as a container for the cell hierarchies read from
the sources.  This will be the top-level cell in the output file.  The
name is arbitrary, but should conform to the standards of the output
file format.  If it should clash with another cell being written from
a source, that file name will be modified to avoid the clash.

It is also possible to run a merge without entering a {\cb Top-Level
Cell Name}.  In this case, the hierarchies extracted from the source
archives are simply concatenated in the output file.  The output file
may then have multiple top-level cells.  Any transformation
information except scaling will be ignored, since transformations
apply to the placement of the hierarchy in the container top-level
cell.

The {\cb Path to New Layout File} field is required; it specifies the
output file.  The format of the output file produced is determined by
the format tab selected at the top of the output page.

The {\cb Create layout File} button initiates to merge operation.  It
should be pressed when all relevant fields in the {\cb Merge Tool}
have been filled in.  Depending upon the number and size of the files
and hardware characteristics, the operation can take seconds to hours. 
When started, a progress monitor pop-up appears.  This displays the
number of bytes read and written, error and warning messages emitted,
and a "working" indication.  An abort button is also provided which
can be used to terminate the operation.

The {\cb Dismiss} button will exit the {\cb Merge Tool} program. 
Unless the {\cb Save} button in the {\cb File} menu has been used, all
entered information will be lost.  The {\cb Save} button can be used
to save the current state of the {\cb Merge Tool} to a file, which can
be read later (with the {\cb Recall} button) to configure the {\cb
Merge Tool} to the same state as was saved.  The file format is that
used as input to the {\cb !assemble} command, and is described there. 
Note that files prepared by hand for use with the {\cb !assemble}
command can be loaded into the {\cb Merge Tool} with the {\cb Recall}
button.

\subsection{The Source Page}

Each input file has at least one corresponding source page.  Only one
page is visible, and it occupies the main part of the {\cb Merge Tool}
display.  The page displayed can be selected by clicking on the {\cb
Source} tabs just below the menu bar.  The entries in the page
identify the cells to extract and the processing to be performed.

The required {\cb Path to Source} field contains the path to the
associated layout file, and the file must be in one of the supported
formats.  This entry can also be the access name of a Cell Hierarchy
Digest (CHD) in memory, or a path to a saved CHD file on disk.  In
either case, the CHD will then be used to access the content of the
associated file.

\subsection{Layer Filtering Module}

The group of entries below the file path controls layer filtering and
aliasing.  These are optional and can be ignored if no layer
manipulations are needed.

The module contains the following controls:

\begin{description}
\item{{\cb Layer List} text area}\\
The {\cb Layer List} can be set to a space-separated list of layer
names.  Each layer name is expected to match an effective layer name
in the file being read.  For file types such as GDSII that designate
layers with layer/datatype integers, either the hex encoding or
decimal form can be used, with wildcarding accepted.  The {\cb Layer
List} is ignored unless one of the following two check boxes is
selected.

\item{{\cb Layers Only} check box}\\
If this box is checked, only the layers listed in the {\cb Layer
List} will be read from the source.

\item{{\cb Skip Layers} check box}\\
This box can be checked if the {\cb Layers Only} box is unchecked. 
When checked, layers listed in the {\cb Layer List} will be ignored in
the source.  All layers except those listed will be read.

\item{{\cb Layer Aliases} text area}\\
This provides a means for converting layers found in input from the
source to a different layer when written to output.  The entered text
contains zero of more space-separated text tokens in the form
\begin{quote}
{\it oldname\/}={\it newname}
\end{quote}
The {\it oldname} is a layer name consistent with the source format. 
For GDSII and OASIS, either hex or decimal encoding is accepted.  The
{\it newname} is the destination layer consistent with the output
format.  Again, gor GDSII and OASIS either the hex or decimal forms
may be used.  There should be no space between the names (or in the
names) and the equal sign `=' separator.
\end{description}

\subsection{Scaling}

There are three different scaling entries which may apply.  If there
are no cells listed in the {\cb Top-Level Cells} entry area, then none
of the ``per cell'' settings (to be described) apply, and the value in
the {\cb Conversion Scale Factor} entry area will be used to scale all
coordinates read from the source.  The {\cb Conversion Scale Factor}
will be ignored if any cells are listed in the {\cb Top-Level Cells}
area, and scaling values will be obtained from the ``per cell''
entries.

The ``per cell'' entries allow scaling of the cell definitions written
to output, and magnification of any instantiations created in a
top-level cell in output.

\begin{description}
\item{{\cb Conversion Scale Factor} numeric entry area}\\
This provides a scale factor for cell data read from the source when
no {\cb Top-Level Cells} have been given.  This value is ignored
otherwise.  This can range from .001 through 1000.0, and is applied to
all coordinates of cells being read from the present source.
\end{description}

\subsection{Cell Name Modification}

This group allows systematic changes to the cell names read from the
source layout file.  If the source is a CHD, then the cell name
modifications described here are performed after any cell
modifications configured into the CHD.

\begin{description}
\item{{\cb Prefix} and {\cb Suffix} text entries}\\
Text entered into these text areas will be added as a prefix or suffix
to cell names encountered when reading the source file.  The entries
are string tokens, containing any alphanumeric characters plus `\$',
`?', `\_'.  String tokens given in this form will be
prepended/appended to each cell name read from the source.

A limited text substitution mechanism is available.  The string tokens
can also have the form /{\it str\/}/{\it sub\/}/ which indicates a
substitution.  This causes the {\it str} if it appears as a
prefix/suffix of a cell name to be replaced by {\it sub}.  The {\it
sub} can be empty (i.e., the form is /{\it str\/}//) which can be used
to undo the previous addition of a prefix or suffix.  Forms like
//{\it sub\/}/ are equivalent to just giving {\it sub} as a string.

\item{{\cb To Lower} and {\cb To Upper} check boxes}\\
If set, {\cb To Lower} will convert upper case cell names to lower
case, and {\cb To Upper} will convert lower case cell names to upper. 
Mixed case cell names are not affected.  Case conversion is performed
before any applied prefix/suffix.
\end{description}

\subsection{Top-Level Cells List}

Each source may have one or more top-level cells specified.  If no
top-level cells are specified the default operation will be as
follows.  If the source is a layout file, the entire file will be
streamed into the output.  If the source is a CHD, the cell hierarchy
of the CHD's default cell will be streamed into the output.  If not
explicitly configured, this will be the first top-level cell in the
file referenced by the CHD.

The top-level cell names are names of cells in the source.  If the
source is a CHD with cell name modification, the names must include
the modification.  These cells, and possibly their hierarchies, will
be used in output.  Note that the cells listed are not necessarily
top-level in the source, any cell in the source file can be listed.

Cells are added to the list by use of the {\cb New Toplevel} button in
the {\cb Options} menu.  Note that the user must generally know the
names of the cells in the source to be extracted.  If an empty cell
name is given at the prompt, the text ``{\vt <default>}'' will
appear in the listing, which will correspond to the default cell of a
CHD source or the first top-level cell found in a source file.  Thus,
it is possible to access the ``top'' cell in a source without knowing
its name.  Giving a cell makes available the ``per cell'' operations
in the {\cb Basic} and {\cb Advanced} pages to the right of the
listing.

One can use the {\cb Contents} list in the {\cb Cell Hierarchy
Digests} listing to list the cell names, if the source has a
corresponding CHD.  Cell names can be dragged directly from the
listing panel and dropped in the {\cb Top-Level Cells} list, bypassing
the need to use the {\cb New Toplevel} menu button.

Clicking on a cell name in the list will select it, enabling
additional ``per-cell'' entries which apply to this cell and its
hierarchy.  The selected cell name can be deleted from the list with
the {\cb Remove Toplevel} button in the {\cb Options} menu.

\subsection{Basic Transformations}

If a cell name is selected in the {\cb Top-Level Cells} listing, the
entries in the {\cb Basic} tab page become enabled.  One may have to
click on the ``Basic'' tab to display the entries.  These control the
transformation of the selected cell when instantiated in the top-level
cell in the output file.  If there is no top-level cell name given,
these entries will be ignored.

\begin{description}
\item{{\cb Placement Name} entry}\\
The {\cb Placement Name} field can be filled in with a new name.  The
selected cell will be saved under this name, rather than its real
name, in output.  Any name modifications in force will be applied to
this name.

\item{{\cb Basic} transformation entries}\\
This tab page contains entries that control the transformation of the
selected cell when instantiated.  The {\cb Placement X,Y} entries set
the translation coordinates in microns.  The origin of the selected
cell will be mapped to this location in the output top-level cell. 
Additionally, the cell instance can be rotated, mirrored, or
magnified.  The {\cb Rotation Angle} menu provides rotation angle
choices:  multiples of 45 degrees.  The {\cb Mirror-Y} button will
invert the Y-coordinates before rotation.  The {\cb Magnification}
entry can change the scaling of the instantiation.
\end{description}

\subsection{Advanced Operations}

When a cell name is selected in the {\cb Top-Level Cells} listing, the
entries in the {\cb Advanced} tab page become enabled.  These
operations apply to the cell data read from the source file for the
selected cell, allowing windowing, flattening, and other operations. 
These are similar to the windowing operations provided in the {\cb
Format Conversion} panel.

\begin{description}
\item{{\cb Use Window} check box}\\
Windowing operations are enabled by setting the {\cb Use Window} check
box.  A window is a rectangular area in the selected cell, which is
specified (in microns) with the four numerical entry boxes.

With windowing enabled, only objects and subcells that have nonzero
overlap with the window will be written to output.  In subcells, only
objects that overlap the window in the context of some instance will
be included.  Thus, only the objects in the file needed to represent
the window area of the selected cell to all depths below the selected
cell will be read from the source.

\item{{\cb Clip} check box}\\
If in addition the {\cb Clip} check box is set, the objects will be
clipped to the window.  This includes objects in subcells.  Note that
this does not guarantee that geometry will not appear outside of the
window, since instance geometry may appear anywhere.

\item{{\cb Flatten} check box}\\
The {\cb Flatten} button will flatten the hierarchy under the selected
cell.  Flattening can be applied with or without windowing.  Along
with windowing and clipping, no geometry will extend outside of the
window area.

\item{\cb Empty Cell Filter}\\
The {\cb pre-filt} and {\cb post-filt} check boxes enable the two
stages of empty cell filtering, as described for the {\cb Format
Conversion} panel in \ref{ecfilt}.

\item{{\cb Scale Factor} entry}\\
The coordinates in the cell and its hierarchy will be scaled by this
factor in output.  This is done logically before any windowing
operations.

\item{{\cb No Hierarchy} check box}\\
If checked, only the cell, and not its subcell hierarchy, will be
included in output.  This can lead to unresolved references in the
output file.
\end{description}

\subsection{Merge Tool Menus}

The {\cb Merge Tool} provides three drop-down menus in the menu bar at
the top of the interactive display:  {\cb File}, {\cb Options}, and
{\cb Help}.  The {\cb File} menu contains entries related to
input/output, and {\cb Options} contains entries for modification of
program operation.  The {\cb Help} menu provides access to
documentation.  This section describes the entries of each menu in
detail.

Some of the menu entries have keyboard accelerators, which are listed
in the menu.  Pressing the accelerator key combination has the same
effect as pressing the menu button, without the need to display the
menu.

\subsection{The File Menu}

The file menu contains command buttons that deal generally with
input/output.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb File Select}\\
The {\cb File Select} button brings up a {\cb File Selection} panel. 
This enables the file hierarchy on the user's computer to be searched
for files.  Selecting a file by double clicking a name of pressing the
green octagon ``Go'' button will enter the full file path into the
{\cb Path to Source} entry of the current {\cb Source} page.

\item{\cb Save}\\
The {\cb Save} button will save the current {\cb Merge Tool}
configuration in a file.  The file format is as described for the {\cb
!assemble} command in \ref{assemble}.  This includes all of the
filled-in entries of all pages currently recorded in the tool.  This
file can be subsequently read to reset the {\cb Merge Tool} to the
saved status.  The generated file is in a simple ASCII format that can
be generated by third-party scripts, etc., by the advanced user.

Pressing the {\cb Save} button will pop-up a small dialog asking for a
name for the file.  This name can be anything, but it is recommended
that a standard extension such as ``{\vt .sav}'' be used to make these
files easily recognized.  Pressing the {\cb Save State} button on the
dialog will generate and save the state file.

\item{\cb Recall}\\
The {\cb Recall} button will read a file previously saved with the
{\cb Save} button, and reconfigure the {\cb Merge Tool} to the state
saved in the file.

Pressing the {\cb Recall} button will pop up a small dialog asking for
the name of the file.  This can be entered directly, or the {\cb File
Selection} panel (from the {\cb File Select} button) can be used to
locate the file.  Once located, the name of the file can be dragged
from the {\cb File Selection} panel and dropped in the dialog.

Pressing the {\cb Recall State} button in the dialog will reconfigure
the {\cb Merge Tool} to the state found in the file.  All entries in
the tool should be as saved.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Options Menu}

The {\cb Options} menu contains buttons that enable making certain
entries into the {\cb Merge Tool} forms, and otherwise induce changes
in configuration.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Reset}\\
Pressing this button will reset the configuration of the {\cb Merge
Tool} to the startup (empty) configuration.  All existing entries will
be lost.

\item{\cb New Source}\\
Each input file from which cells are to be extracted, termed a
``Source'', has a separate page in the {\cb Merge Tool} display.  At
startup, there is one empty source page, which is specified as
``Source 1'' in the tab at the top of the display.  The {\cb New
Source} button will create a new empty source page, with a new tab
with a unique name.  The new page will become the visible page.  Other
source pages can be selected by clicking on the tabs.  Each source
page must be filled in with the appropriate entries before a merge can
be performed.

\item{\cb Remove Source}\\
Pressing this button will irretrievably delete the currently visible
source page, if it is not the initial ``Source 1'' page.  The page and
its tab and contents will disappear.

\item{\cb New Toplevel}\\
This will add the name of a top level cell to the {\cb Top-Level
Cells} list of the current page.  These are cells that represent the
top level of hierarchies to be extracted from the archive file named
in the {\cb Path to Source} entry on the same page.  The names in the
list must match an actual cell name found in the file.  These are
``top-level'' in the extraction sense and need not be top-level in the
overall cell hierarchy of the file.  The list can contain the same
name multiple times if multiple instances of the cell are needed in
output.

Note that the user must have knowledge of the names of the cells used
in the file.  The names specified must be the actual names found in
the file, and do not reflect name changes that might be applied during
processing.

\item{\cb Remove Toplevel}\\
This will remove the highlighted entry in the {\cb Top-Level Cells}
list, if an entry is highlighted.  An entry is highlighted by clicking
on it with the mouse.  When an entry is removed, it will not appear in
the output.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Help Menu}

The {\cb Help} menu provides access to {\cb Merge Tool} on-line
documentation.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Help}\\
This brings up the help system.

    <img src="screenshots/compare1.png" align=right>
    The <b>Compare Layouts</b> button in the <b>Convert Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Compare Layouts</b> panel.  This is a graphical
    front-end for the <a href="!compare"><b>!compare</b></a> command,
    used to compare the contents of cells and hierarchies.

    <p>
    There are three different comparison modes, which can be selected
    with the notebook tabs at the top of the panel.  The <b>Per-Cell
    Objects</b> mode will compare objects directly:  box-to-box,
    poly-to-poly, etc.  A difference will be recorded if an object
    does not have an identical counterpart in the other cell.  In this
    mode only, there is provision for comparing the properties of the
    cells, objects and instances.  In other modes, properties are
    ignored.

    <br clear=all>
    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/compare2.png" align=right>
    The <b>Per-Cell Geometry</b> mode will first convert the geometry
    to trapezoids, then compare the coverage of the trapezoid lists. 
    Only differences in the actual dark-area will be reported.  Both
    of these modes apply only to the geometry within a cell.

    <br clear=all>
    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/compare3.png" align=right>
    The third mode, <b>Flat Geometry</b>, will compare the geometry
    after (logically) flattening the hierarchy.  More detail will be
    provided below.

    <p>
    The lower half of the panel provides input areas for parameters
    that are used in any mode.  The top two groups provide the sources
    to be compared.  The <b>Source</b> entries can contain the name of
    a layout file in any of the <a href="xic:fsaf">supported
    formats</a>, or the name of a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy
    Digest</a> (CHD) in memory.  If left blank, the source is taken as
    the main database.  Both <b>Source</b> entries may be blank in
    <b>Per-Cell Objects</b> mode, in order to compare cells in memory
    (in the current symbol table).  The second <b>Source</b> entry can
    be left empty in any but the <b>Flat Geometry</b> mode, in which
    case the cells to compare must exist in memory, in the current
    symbol table.  The top (left pointing) <b>Source</b> is the
    "reference" when the list of cells to compare is generated, so
    there is an asymmetry that should be kept in mind, which will be
    further discussed below.

    <p>
    If a file name is given as a source, a temporary CHD is created
    for use during the comparison, and is destroyed when the operation
    completes.  Thus, when doing repeated comparisons, it is more
    efficient to create a CHD first, and reference this CHD for
    comparisons.

    <p>
    The actual list of cells to compare is generated from entries in
    the <b>Cells</b> and <b>Equiv</b> entry areas by logic to be
    described.  These entry areas, if not blank, should contain
    space-separated cell names.

    <p>
    In many cases, there is only one list of cells to compare, and
    each cell is sought in both sources.  If a cell is found in one
    source and not the other, this will appear in the log file, but is
    not considered to be an error.  The cells list in this case is
    always given in the <b>Cells</b> entry.

    <p>
    If an <b>Equiv</b> list is given, there must be exactly the same
    number of entries given in the <b>Cells</b> list.  The cells in
    the two lists will be compared term-by-term, in order.  This is
    how one can compare cells with differing names.  In all other
    cases, the <b>Equiv</b> list should be left blank.  It is an error
    if <b>Equiv</b> entries are given with <b>Cells</b> blank, or if
    the list lengths differ.  However, the <b>Equiv</b> list is
    ignored if in a per-cell comparison mode and <b>Recurse Into
    Hierarchy</b> is checked.

    <p>
    The interpretation of a blank <b>Cells</b> list depends on the
    comparison mode.  If in flat comparison mode, or in a per-cell
    mode and the <b>Recurse Into Hierarchy</b> button is set, then the
    assumed cell list contains only the default cell from the top
    (left pointing) source.  If this was a CHD name, the default cell
    is the one <a href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> into the CHD, or
    the first top-level cell found in the source file.  In the other
    cases, a blank <b>Cells</b> list is interpreted as all cells found
    in the top (left pointing) source.

    <p>
    In the special case that neither a left or right source is
    specified, then the <b>Cells</b> and <b>Equiv</b> lists can not be
    empty, and the names are cells in memory to compare.

    <p>
    In the per-cell modes with <b>Recurse Into Hierarchy</b> set,
    each entry in the <b>Cells</b> list is hierarchically expanded to
    a full list of the cells under the given cell, and these names are
    merged into a new list that contains no duplicates.  If no
    <b>Cells</b> list was given, per the discussion above, the cell
    list is effectively the hierarchy of the default cell from the
    first source.

    <p>
    Below the source groups is a provision for layer-filtering.  This
    is active when one of <b>Layers Only</b> or <b>Skip Layers</b> is
    pressed.  The list contains space-separated layer names.  With
    <b>Layers Only</b> active, only objects on the listed layers will
    be compared.  With the <b>Skip Layers</b> button pressed (which
    deactivates <b>Layers Only</b> and vice-versa), only layers
    <b>not</b> listed will be considered.  If neither button pressed,
    or if the layer list is empty, all layers will be considered.

    <p>
    During comparison, differences are recorded in an output file.  By
    default, geometric differences are saved in a CIF-like format,
    providing lists of objects that appear in one cell but not the
    other.  If the <b>Differ Only</b> check box is active, the
    geometric information is not written to the file, only the
    information that the cells differ.

    <p>
    The maximum number of differences that are recorded can be set
    with the <b>Maximum Differences</b> input area.  If 0, then there
    is no limit.  Otherwise, when the limit is reached, the comparison
    will terminate.  It is usually advisable to set a limit, as an
    error in the source specification can potentially produce enormous
    output.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Go</b> button initiates comparison.  When the job
    finishes, the user is given the option of viewing the log file. 
    The log file is always named <tt>diff.log</tt> and is created in
    the current directory.  An existing file of the same name is moved
    to a new name with a <tt>.bak</tt> extension added.  The <a
    href="!diffcells"><b>!diffcells</b></a> command can be used to
    create cells from the log file for visualizing the differences.

    <p>
    The <b>Dismiss</b> button retires the panel.  All entries are
    persistent, meaning that the panel will contain the same entered
    content the next time it appears.

    <a name="cmpage"></a>
    <h2>Comparison Mode Pages</h2>

    The comparison mode can be selected by clicking on the tabs at the
    top of the panel.  Both of the per-cell modes contain <b>Recurse
    Into Hierarchy</b> and <b>Expand Array</b> buttons.  The
    <b>Recurse Into Hierarchy</b> check box indicates that the cell to
    compare is to be taken as the top of a hierarchy, and this and all
    descendent cells should be compared.  If not set, only the named
    cell is compared.

    <p>
    The <b>Expand Arrays</b> button applies when cell instances are
    being checked.  When set, instance arrays are logically converted
    to individual placements before comparison.  This avoids flagging
    differences that are due only to whether instances are arrayed or
    not, or whether that arraying is the same.  This is useful when
    comparing OASIS files to GDSII files, for example, where the OASIS
    repetition finder may have been used.

    <p>
    Electrical cells can be compared using the <b>Per-Cell Objects</b>
    mode only.  The mode to compare is selected on the page, which may
    be different from the current mode of the program.

    <p>
    When using <b>Per-Cell Objects</b>, one may select which type of
    objects to compare.  Objects types that are not active are
    ignored.  By default, text labels are ignored and all other
    objects are compared.  A difference is indicated if a tested
    object does not have an identical counterpart in the other cell. 

    <p>
    Comparison of labels can lead to false differences when comparing
    cells read from different file formats, since label bounding boxes
    are not well defined across file format conversion.

    <p>
    The <b>Per-Cell Objects</b> page contains a <b>Box to Wire/Poly
    Check</b> check box.  With this mode selected, a two-vertex wire
    or four-vertex polygon that is rendered as a Manhattan rectangle
    will match a rectangle object with the same dimensions.  Thus,
    files that have had these features converted to boxes to save
    space can be directly compared, without a lot of spurious entries
    in output.

    <p>
    The <b>Ignore Duplicates</b> check box in the <b>Per-Cell
    Objects</b> page sets a mode where if duplicate objects are
    present in one or both of the files, unmatched duplicates will not
    be reported if one of the duplicates has a match.  Thus files with
    duplicates removed can be compared with the original file, and the
    duplicates will not appear in output as differences.

    <p>
    In <b>Per-Cell Geometry</b> mode, all boxes, polygons, and wires
    are included.  Text labels are ignored.  A button provides a
    choice whether or not to check subcells, which are tested as in
    the per-cell object mode.

    <p>
    When using <b>Per-Cell Geometry</b> mode, the geometry is compared
    within areas of a grid whose size is given by the <a
    href="PartitionSize"><b>PartitionSize</b></a> variable. 
    Experimenting with this size can lead to improved speed, depending
    on the layout density.  The default partition size is 100 microns. 
    For best performance, this can be increased for low density, or
    reduced for high density, where "density" refers to the number of
    trapezoids per area.

    <p>
    The <b>Flat Geometry</b> mode is somewhat orthogonal to the other
    modes.  The algorithm uses two levels of gridding to partition the
    layout into pieces, and directly compares the geometry in each
    fine grid cell.  This is very similar to the algorithm described
    for the <a
    href="ChdIterateOverRegion"><tt>ChdIterateOverRegion</tt></a>
    script function.

    <p>
    The fine grid size is entered in microns, the coarse grid size is
    entered as an integer multiple of the fine grid size.  The flat
    geometry to render a coarse grid cell is held in memory, but
    subdivided into the fine grid cells for the comparison.  Using a
    large coarse grid with a dense layout may trigger memory
    availability issues, yet using a large coarse grid usually
    improves speed.  The user should experiment with the parameter
    values to see what works best with their layouts.  The fine grid
    can be in the range of 1.0 to 100.0 microns, and the multiplier
    can be in the range 1 - 100.

    <p>
    If the <b>Use Window</b> button is active, a rectangle entered
    into the entries (in microns) can be used to limit the comparison
    area.  If not active, an area covering the entire bounding box of
    both cells being compared is used.  The <b>S</b> and <b>R</b>
    buttons provide access to eight general purpose storage registers
    for rectangles, as provided in other panels that use rectangle
    data.

    <a name="prop"></a>
    <h2>Property List Comparison</h2>

    The <b>Per-Cell Objects</b> mode allows properties to be compared,
    unlike the other modes.  There are three classes of properties: 
    structure (cell) properties, cell instance properties, and object
    properties.

    <p>
    Whether or not to check properties can be set independently for
    each type of object.  Properties of a given object type will only
    be compared when enabled by checking the boxes in the
    <b>Properties</b> group, plus the <b>Structure Properties</b>
    check box.  When not checked, the properties of the corresponding
    object, cell instance, or the structure, will be ignored.

    <p>
    Property lists of objects and instances are only compared between
    otherwise identical objects or instances.  Cell structure property
    lists will be compared whether or not other differences are found,
    when enabled.

    <p>
    There are three filters that can be applied, to reduce the number
    of properties compared.  These correspond to cell properties,
    instance properties, and object properties.  Further, different
    filtering is applied when comparing electrical and physical mode
    data.  The <b>Property Filtering</b> option menu and <b>Setup</b>
    button control the filtering applied.

    <p>
    The <b>Default</b> choice of the menu applies default filtering. 
    With this choice, there is no filtering (all properties
    considered) when comparing physical mode data.  In electrical
    mode, the following defaults are applied:

    <dl>
    <dt>Cell properties<dd>
    Compare only PARAM, VIRTUAL, NEWMUT, SYMBLC, and NODMAP properties.
    <dt>Instance properties<dd>
    Compare only MODEL, VALUE, PARAM, and NOPHYS properties.
    <dt>Object properties<dd>
    Ignore all electrical properties of objects.
    </dl>

    <p>
    This filtering limits the comparison to properties over which the
    user has control, and whose differences are likely to indicate an
    actual design difference.

    <p>
    The <b>None</b> choice of the menu effectively turns filtering
    off, for both electrical and physical modes.  This is
    comprehensive, but for electrical mode a lot of the internal
    properties, for example NODE properties, will be flagged as
    differing but may not represent a true difference in the design as
    the strings may include arbitrary internal assignments for some
    parameters.

    <p>
    The third possible menu choice, <b>Custom</b> allows the user to
    completely specify the filtering behavior.  This is described in a
    separate <a href="xic:prpfilt">Custom Property Filtering</a>
    section.  The filtering is specified from the pop-up produced by
    pressing the <b>Setup</b> button.

    <p>
    Properties are compared by number and string.  In the output file,
    property comparison result lines are all in comment form (with
    '<tt>#</tt>' as the first character) so that they will be ignored
    if the file is subsequently processed with the <a
    href="!diffcells"><b>!diffcells</b></a> command.  Property
    comparison results consist of a string indicating the cell,
    instance, or object containing the properties.  If an instance or
    object, this is common to both input sources.  Following this are
    listings of properties found in one source and not the other. 
    Properties that are identical in the two sources are not listed.
!!LATEX xic:diff cvrtmenu.tex
The {\cb Compare Layouts} button in the {\cb Convert Menu} brings up
the {\cb Compare Layouts} panel.  This is a graphical front-end for
the {\cb !compare} command, used to compare the contents of cells and
hierarchies.

There are three different comparison modes, which can be selected with
the notebook tabs at the top of the panel.  The {\cb Per-Cell Objects}
mode will compare objects directly:  box-to-box, poly-to-poly, etc.  A
difference will be recorded if an object does not have an identical
counterpart in the other cell.  In this mode only, there is provision
for comparing the properties of the cells, objects and instances.  In
other modes, properties are ignored.

The {\cb Per-Cell Geometry} mode will first convert the geometry to
trapezoids, then compare the coverage of the trapezoid lists.  Only
differences in the actual dark-area will be reported.  Both of these
modes apply only to the geometry within a cell.  The third mode, {\cb
Flat Geometry}, will compare the geometry after (logically) flattening
the hierarchy.  More detail will be provided below.

The lower half of the panel provides input areas for parameters that
are used in any mode.  The top two groups provide the sources to be
compared.  The {\cb Source} entries can contain the name of a layout
file in any of the supported formats, or the name of a Cell Hierarchy
Digest (CHD) in memory.  If left blank, the source is taken as the
main database.  Both {\cb Source} entries may be blank in {\cb
Per-Cell Objects} mode, in order to compare cells in memory (in the
current symbol table).  The second {\cb Source} entry can be left
empty in any but the {\cb Flat Geometry} mode, in which case the cells
to compare must exist in memory, in the current symbol table.  The top
(left pointing) {\cb Source} is the ``reference'' when the list of
cells to compare is generated, so there is an asymmetry that should be
kept in mind, which will be further discussed below.

If a file name is given as a source, a temporary CHD is created for
use during the comparison, and is destroyed when the operation
completes.  Thus, when doing repeated comparisons, it is more
efficient to create a CHD first, and reference this CHD for
comparisons.

The actual list of cells to compare is generated from entries in the
{\cb Cells} and {\cb Equiv} entry areas by logic to be described. 
These entry areas, if not blank, should contain space-separated cell
names.

In many cases, there is only one list of cells to compare, and each
cell is sought in both sources.  If a cell is found in one source and
not the other, this will appear in the log file, but is not considered
to be an error.  The cells list in this case is always given in the
{\cb Cells} entry.

If an {\cb Equiv} list is given, there must be exactly the same number
of entries given in the {\cb Cells} list.  The cells in the two lists
will be compared term-by-term, in order.  This is how one can compare
cells with differing names.  In all other cases, the {\cb Equiv} list
should be left blank.  It is an error if {\cb Equiv} entries are given
with {\cb Cells} blank, or if the list lengths differ.  However, the
{\cb Equiv} list is ignored if in a per-cell comparison mode and {\cb
Recurse Into Hierarchy} is checked.

The interpretation of a blank {\cb Cells} list depends on the
comparison mode.  If in flat comparison mode, or in a per-cell mode
and the {\cb Recurse Into Hierarchy} button is set, then the assumed
cell list contains only the default cell from the top (left pointing)
source.  If this was a CHD name, the default cell is the one
configured into the CHD, or the first top-level cell found in the
source file.  In the other cases, a blank {\cb Cells} list is
interpreted as all cells found in the top (left pointing) source.

In the special case that neither a left or right source is specified,
then the {\cb Cells} and {\cb Equiv} lists can not be empty, and the
names are cells in memory to compare.

In the per-cell modes with {\cb Recurse Into Hierarchy} set, each
entry in the {\cb Cells} list is hierarchically expanded to a full
list of the cells under the given cell, and these names are merged
into a new list that contains no duplicates.  If no {\cb Cells} list
was given, per the discussion above, the cell list is effectively the
hierarchy of the default cell from the first source.

Below the source groups is a provision for layer-filtering.  This is
active when one of {\cb Layers Only} or {\cb Skip Layers} is pressed. 
The list contains space-separated layer names.  With {\cb Layers Only}
active, only objects on the listed layers will be compared.  With the
{\cb Skip Layers} button pressed (which deactivates {\cb Layers Only}
and vice-versa), only layers {\bf not} listed will be considered.  If
neither button pressed, or if the layer list is empty, all layers will
be considered.

During comparison, differences are recorded in an output file.  By
default, geometric differences are saved in a CIF-like format,
providing lists of objects that appear in one cell but not the other. 
If the {\cb Differ Only} check box is active, the geometric
information is not written to the file, only the information that the
cells differ.

The maximum number of differences that are recorded can be set with
the {\cb Maximum Differences} input area.  If 0, then there is no
limit.  Otherwise, when the limit is reached, the comparison will
terminate.  It is usually advisable to set a limit, as an error in the
source specification can potentially produce enormous output.

Pressing the {\cb Go} button initiates comparison.  When the job
finishes, the user is given the option of viewing the log file.  The
log file is always named {\vt diff.log} and is created in the current
directory.  An existing file of the same name is moved to a new name
with a {\vt .bak} extension added.  The {\cb !diffcells} command can
be used to create cells from the log file for visualizing the
differences.

The {\cb Dismiss} button retires the panel.  All entries are
persistent, meaning that the panel will contain the same entered
content the next time it appears.

\subsection{Comparison Mode Pages}

The comparison mode can be selected by clicking on the tabs at the top
of the panel.  Both of the per-cell modes contain {\cb Recurse Into
Hierarchy} and {\cb Expand Array} buttons.  The {\cb Recurse Into
Hierarchy} check box indicates that the cell to compare is to be taken
as the top of a hierarchy, and this and all descendent cells should be
compared.  If not set, only the named cell is compared.

The {\cb Expand Arrays} button applies when cell instances are being
checked.  When set, instance arrays are logically converted to
individual placements before comparison.  This avoids flagging
differences that are due only to whether instances are arrayed or not,
or whether that arraying is the same.  This is useful when comparing
OASIS files to GDSII files, for example, where the OASIS repetition
finder may have been used.

Electrical cells can be compared using the {\cb Per-Cell Objects} mode
only.  The mode to compare is selected on the page, which may be
different from the current mode of the program.

When using {\cb Per-Cell Objects}, one may select which type of
objects to compare.  Objects types that are not active are ignored. 
By default, text labels are ignored and all other objects are
compared.  A difference is indicated if a tested object does not have
an identical counterpart in the other cell.

Comparison of labels can lead to false differences when comparing
cells read from different file formats, since label bounding boxes are
not well defined across file format conversion.

The {\cb Per-Cell Objects} page contains a {\cb Box to Wire/Poly
Check} check box.  With this mode selected, a two-vertex wire or
four-vertex polygon that is rendered as a Manhattan rectangle will
match a rectangle object with the same dimensions.  Thus, files that
have had these features converted to boxes to save space can be
directly compared, without a lot of spurious entries in output.

The {\cb Ignore Duplicates} check box in the {\cb Per-Cell Objects}
page sets a mode where if duplicate objects are present in one or both
of the files, unmatched duplicates will not be reported if one of the
duplicates has a match.  Thus files with duplicates removed can be
compared with the original file, and the duplicates will not appear in
output as differences.

In {\cb Per-Cell Geometry} mode, all boxes, polygons, and wires are
included.  Text labels are ignored.  A button provides a choice
whether or not to check subcells, which are tested as in the per-cell
object mode.

When using {\cb Per-Cell Geometry} mode, the geometry is compared
within areas of a grid whose size is given by the {\et PartitionSize}
variable.  Experimenting with this size can lead to improved speed,
depending on the layout density.  The default partition size is 100
microns.  For best performance, this can be increased for low density,
or reduced for high density, where ``density'' refers to the number of
trapezoids per area.

The {\cb Flat Geometry} mode is somewhat orthogonal to the other
modes.  The algorithm uses two levels of gridding to partition the
layout into pieces, and directly compares the geometry in each fine
grid cell.  This is very similar to the algorithm described for the
{\vt ChdIterateOverRegion} script function.

The fine grid size is entered in microns, the coarse grid size is
entered as an integer multiple of the fine grid size.  The flat
geometry to render a coarse grid cell is held in memory, but
subdivided into the fine grid cells for the comparison.  Using a large
coarse grid with a dense layout may trigger memory availability
issues, yet using a large coarse grid usually improves speed.  The
user should experiment with the parameter values to see what works
best with their layouts.  The fine grid can be in the range of 1.0 to
100.0 microns, and the multiplier can be in the range 1 -- 100.

If the {\cb Use Window} button is active, a rectangle entered into the
entries (in microns) can be used to limit the comparison area.  If not
active, an area covering the entire bounding box of both cells being
compared is used.  The {\cb S} and {\cb R} buttons provide access to
eight general purpose storage registers for rectangles, as provided in
other panels that use rectangle data.

\subsection{Property List Comparison}

The {\cb Per-Cell Objects} mode allows properties to be compared,
unlike the other modes.  There are three classes of properties: 
structure (cell) properties, cell instance properties, and object
properties.

Whether or not to check properties can be set independently for each
type of object.  Properties of a given object type will only be
compared when enabled by checking the boxes in the {\cb Properties}
group, plus the {\cb Structure Properties} check box.  When not
checked, the properties of the corresponding object, cell instance, or
the structure, will be ignored.

Property lists of objects and instances are only compared between
otherwise identical objects or instances.  Cell structure property
lists will be compared whether or not other differences are found,
when enabled.

There are three filters that can be applied, to reduce the number of
properties compared.  These correspond to cell properties, instance
properties, and object properties.  Further, different filtering is
applied when comparing electrical and physical mode data.  The {\cb
Property Filtering} option menu and {\cb Setup} button control the
filtering applied.

The {\cb Default} choice of the menu applies default filtering.  With
this choice, there is no filtering (all properties considered) when
comparing physical mode data.  In electrical mode, the following
defaults are applied:

\begin{description}
\item{Cell properties}\\
Compare only PARAM, VIRTUAL, NEWMUT, SYMBLC, and NODMAP properties.
\item{Instance properties}\\
Compare only MODEL, VALUE, PARAM, and NOPHYS properties.
\item{Object properties}\\
Ignore all electrical properties of objects.
\end{description}

This filtering limits the comparison to properties over which the user
has control, and whose differences are likely to indicate an actual design
difference.

The {\cb None} choice of the menu effectively turns filtering off, for
both electrical and physical modes.  This is comprehensive, but for
electrical mode a lot of the internal properties, for example NODE
properties, will be flagged as differing but may not represent a true
difference in the design as the strings may include arbitrary internal
assignments for some parameters.

The third possible menu choice, {\cb Custom} allows the user to
completely specify the filtering behavior.  This is described in the
next section.  The filtering is specified from the pop-up produced by
pressing the {\cb Setup} button.

Properties are compared by number and string.  In the output file,
property comparison result lines are all in comment form (with `{\vt
\#}' as the first character) so that they will be ignored if the file
is subsequently processed with the {\cb !diffcells} command.  Property
comparison results consist of a string indicating the cell, instance,
or object containing the properties.  If an instance or object, this
is common to both input sources.  Following this are listings of
properties found in one source and not the other.  Properties that are
identical in the two sources are not listed.

    <p>
    This panel allows the user to set up the custom property filter
    strings for the cell, cell instances, and objects, for both
    electrical and physical mode comparisons.  These filtering
    definitions are applied when layout comparison is being performed
    from the <b>Compare Layouts</b> panel in <b>Per-Cell Objects</b>
    mode, with the <b>Property Filtering</b> menu set to <b>Custom</b>
    and property checking enabled.  The filtering also applies when
    using the <a href="!compare"><b>!compare</b></a> command, when

    The six entry areas correspond to six variables, which can

    <p>
    If the entry area is empty, the corresponding variable is unset,
    and the default filtering will be applied.  Otherwise, the string
    determines the filtering applied.

    <p>
    The strings consist of space and/or comma-separated lists of
    numbers or equivalent names.  The names are simply mnemonics to
    the electrical properties, and are:
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Use of numbers and equivalent names is arbitrary and they can be
    mixed.  Names will be recognized if at least the leading two
    characters are given, with enough additional characters so as to
    uniquely prefix one of the names in the list above.  Names that
    are not recognized are silently ignored.

    <p>
    Specifying a list as described indicates that only the listed
    properties will be considered.  However, it is possible to invert
    this logic.

    <p>
    If the first character in the string is '<tt>s</tt>', and the
    second character is not '<tt>y</tt>' (to avoid a clash with
    "<tt>symblc</tt>"), then the properties in the list that follows
    will be skipped, i.e., only properties not in the list will be
    considered.  If the leading '<tt>s</tt>' is recognized as the
    "skip" indicator, all alphabetic characters up to the first
    delimiter or number will be stripped before parsing the list.

    <p>
    The recognition of names and the skip indicator are
    case-insensitive.

    <p>
    For example, the following specifications are all equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>s1,2,3</tt><br>
    <tt>skip1,2,3</tt><br>
    <tt>skip,1,2,3</tt><br>
    <tt>skip 1 2 3</tt><br>
    <tt>skip,model,value,param</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    An empty entry area will trigger default filtering and is
    <b>not</b> an empty filter (blocking all).  To provide an empty
    list, which blocks all properties from comparison, simply insert a
    character that is not recognized as a property number or
    '<tt>s</tt>'.  Just about anything will do, one choice would be
    '<tt>-</tt>'.  This will have the intended effect of setting up a
    filter with no elements, which will not match any values.

    <p>
    There is one more subtlety that may be encountered.  In graphical
    mode, it is not possible to set the variables as booleans, i.e.,
    to nothing.  The graphical system will immediately unset the
    variable if this is attempted.  However, in non-graphics mode, this
    won't happen, and the variables will take the null assignment.  In
    this case, the corresponding filter will block all, rather than
    reverting to the default filter.

The {\cb Custom Property Filter Setup} panel is presented in response
to pressing the {\cb Setup} button in the {\cb Per-Cell Objects} page
of the {\cb Compare Layouts} panel.  The {\cb Compare Layouts} panel
is obtained from the {\cb Compare Layouts} button in the {\cb Convert
Menu}.

This panel allows the user to set up the custom property filter
strings for the cell, cell instances, and objects, for both electrical
and physical mode comparisons.  These filtering definitions are
applied when layout comparison is being performed from the {\cb
Compare Layouts} panel in {\cb Per-Cell Objects} mode, with the {\cb
Property Filtering} menu set to {\cb Custom} and property checking
enabled.  The filtering also applies when using the {\cb !compare}
command, when neither of the {\vt -f} or {\vt -g} options is given,
and the {\vt -u} option is given and property checking is enabled.

The six entry areas correspond to six variables, which can
(equivalently) be set directly.  These variables are
\begin{quote} \et
PhysPrpFltCell\\

\end{quote}

If the entry area is empty, the corresponding variable is unset, and
the default filtering will be applied.  Otherwise, the string

The strings consist of space and/or comma-separated lists of numbers

`{\vt s}' is recognized as the ``skip'' indicator, all alphabetic
characters up to the first delimiter or number will be stripped before
parsing the list.

The recognition of names and the skip indicator are case-insensitive.

For example, the following specifications are all equivalent:
