!!TITLE
Keyboard '!' Commands
!!HTML
    The command line interface through the <a href="promptline">prompt
    area</a> provides an interface to operating system commands, as
    well as to a number of internal commands which are often rather
    specialized and not associated with a menu button.  Each of these
    commands starts with an exclamation point ('!'), and may be
    entered when no other command is active, or inside of many
    commands.  These key presses are not recorded in the "keys" area
    below the side menu.  If the command entered matches one of the
    internal commands listed below, that command is executed. 
    Otherwise, an operating system shell and associated window is
    produced to execute the command, with the exclamation mark
    stripped.

    <p>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!</tt></b><br>
    Entering a single exclamation point with no other text will
    produce an interactive terminal window into which the user can
    issue operating system commands.  If any text follows the
    exclamation point, and that text does not match an internal
    command, the exclamation point will be stripped, the remaining
    text sent to the operating system for execution, and the result
    will be displayed in a pop-up window.

    <p>
    Giving the bare exclamation point is equivalent to giving the <a
    href="!shell"><b>!shell</b></a> command without arguments.  Giving
    something like <tt>!xyz</tt> is equivalent to giving <tt>!shell
    xyz</tt>, provided that <tt>!xyz</tt> is not one of the built-in
    commands.  The use of <tt>!shell</tt> removes the ambiguity.

    <p>
    <a name="bangbang"></a>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!!</tt></b><br>
    If a line starts with "<tt>!!</tt>" the rest of the line is taken
    as a <a href="xicscript">script</a>, and executed by the script
    parser.  This is how to map script interface functions into a
    macro.  For example, below is a macro to reset the current
    transform:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>!!SetTransform(0,0,1)</tt> <b>Ctrl-Return</b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!?</tt></b><br>
    Entering "<tt>!?</tt>" will bring up help about the '<tt>!</tt>'
    commands.

    <p>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!?</tt></b><i>name</i><br>
    This special form will bring up help about the help database keyword
    <i>name</i>.

    <p>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!??</tt></b><br>
    This special form will print a listing of the '!' commands
    actually available in the program, from internal tables.

    <p>
    <b>Special Form:  <tt>!#</tt></b><br>
    The last six commands given are saved, and can be recalled with the
    form "<tt>!#[<i>n</i>]</tt>", that is, an exclamation point and a
    pound sign followed by an optional integer.  The <i>n</i> is an
    optional integer 0-5, and if not given (the square brackets
    indicate "optional" and are not literal) a value of 0 is taken. 
    The <i>n</i>'th previous command will be printed in the prompt
    area, where it can be edited and re-executed.  If no matching
    command is found, there is no action.

    <p>
    When a command from the history list is in the prompt area, the
    <b>Up Arrow</b> and <b>Down Arrow</b> keys can be used to cycle
    through the other commands in the history list, each of which will
    be entered into the prompt line in response to the key press.

    <p>
    Each '<tt>!</tt>' command given, including those from
    '<tt>!#</tt>', will be pushed onto the history list in the 0
    position if it is not identical to the previous command given.
     
    <p>
    The following table summarizes the internal commands available.

The command line interface through the prompt area provides an
interface to operating system commands, as well as to a number of
internal commands which are often rather specialized and are not
associated with a menu button.  Each of these commands starts with an
exclamation point ``{\cb !}'', and may be entered when no other
command is active, or inside of many commands.  These key presses are
not recorded in the ``keys'' area below the side menu.  If the command
entered matches one of the internal commands listed below, that
command is executed.  Otherwise, an operating system shell and
associated window is produced to execute the command, with the
exclamation mark stripped.

\index{"! command}
\index{shell escape}
{\bf Special Form:  !}\\
Entering a single exclamation point with no other text will produce an
interactive terminal window into which the user can issue operating
system commands.  If any text follows the exclamation point, and that
text does not match an internal command, the exclamation point will be
stripped, the remaining text sent to the operating system for
execution, and the result will be displayed in a pop-up window.

Giving the bare exclamation point is equivalent to giving the {\cb
!shell} command without arguments (see \ref{shellcmd}).  Giving
something like {\vt !xyz} is equivalent to giving {\vt !shell xyz},
provided that {\vt !xyz} is not one of the built-in commands.  The use
of {\vt !shell} removes the ambiguity.

\index{scripts, from prompt line}
{\bf Special Form:  !!}\\
If a line starts with ``{\cb !!}'', the rest of the line is taken as a
script, and executed by the script parser.  This is how to map script
interface functions into a macro.  For example, below is a macro to reset
the current transform:
\begin{quote}
{\vt !!SetTransform(0,0,1)} {\kb Ctrl-Return}
\end{quote}

{\bf Special Form:  !?}\\
Entering ``{\cb !?}'' will bring up help about the `{\cb !}' commands.

{\bf Special Form:  !?{\it name}}\\
This special form will bring up help about the help database keyword
{\it name}.

{\bf Special Form:  !??}\\
This special form will print a listing of the `!' commands 
actually available in the program, from internal tables.

{\bf Special Form:  !\#}\\
The last six commands given are saved, and can be recalled with the
form ``{\cb !\#}[{\it n\/}]'', that is, an exclamation point and a
pound sign followed by an optional integer.  The {\it n} is an
optional integer 0--5, and if not given (the square brackets indicate
``optional'' and are not literal) a value of 0 is taken.  The {\it
n\/}'th previous command will be printed in the prompt area, where it
can be edited and re-executed.  If no matching command is found, there
is no action.
       
When a command from the history list is in the prompt area, the {\kb
Up Arrow} and {\kb Down Arrow} keys can be used to cycle through the
other commands in the history list, each of which will be entered into
the prompt line in response to the key press.

Each `{\cb !}' command given, including those from `{\cb !\#}', will
be pushed onto the history list in the 0 position if it is not
identical to the previous command given.

    </td></tr></table>

    <p>
    The <b>!assemble</b> command automates reading of cells from
    archives, subsequent processing, and writing to a new archive
    file.  It provides the capabilities of the <a
    href="xic:convt"><b>Format Conversion</b></a> panel in the <a
    href="xic:cvrtmenu"><b>Convert Menu</b></a>, such as format
    translation, windowing, and flattening.  Additionally, multiple
    input files and cells can be processed and merged into a larger
    archive, on-the-fly or by using a <a href="xic:hier">Cell
    Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) so as to avoid memory limitations. 
    Cell definitions for the read and possibly modified cells are
    streamed into the output file, and the output file can contain a
    new top-level cell in which the cells read are instantiated.  The
    input and output can be any of the supported <a
    href="xic:fsaf">archive formats</a>, in any combination.
    <br clear=all>

    <br>
    <b>Syntax: <tt>!assemble</tt> <i>specfile</i> | <i>argument_list</i></b>

    <p>
    The operation can be controlled by a specification script file, the
    path to which is given as the argument.  The script uses a
    language that is unique to this command, which will be described. 
    This supplies the output file name and the description of the
    top-level cell (if any), the files to be used as input, the cells
    to extract from these files, and the operations to perform.  It is
    a simple text file, prepared by the user, containing a number of
    keywords with values.  The specification script can also be
    obtained from the <a href="xic:assem"><b>Assemble</b></a> command
    in the <b>Convert Menu</b>, which is a graphical front-end to the
    <b>!assemble</b> command.

    <p>
    Alternatively, the argument list can consist of a series of option
    tokens and values.  These are logically almost equivalent to the
    language of the specification file.  This gives the user the
    option to enter job descriptions entirely from the command line. 
    These command-line options start with a '-' character.  If the
    first argument given starts with '-', a list of option arguments
    is assumed, otherwise the argument is taken as a file name.  If
    the specification file name starts with '-', one should prepend
    the name with "<tt>./</tt>" to avoid a parse error.

    <p>
    Only physical data are read, electrical data will be stripped in
    output.  A log file is produced when the <b>!assemble</b> command
    is run.  If not explicitly set with a
    <tt>LogFile</tt>/<tt>-log</tt> specification, this is named
    "<tt>assemble.log</tt>" and is written in the current directory. 
    The log file contains warning and error messages emitted by the
    readers during file processing, and should be consulted if a
    problem occurs.

    <a name="input"></a>
    <h2>File and Option Argument Format</h2>

    The <b>!assemble</b> command parses and executes a specification
    file or option list in the format described below.  The file text
    contains keyword directives and values which specify the
    operations to be performed.  Each active line begins with a
    keyword, and all keywords are case-insensitive.  Blank lines and
    lines that begin with non-alpha characters are taken as comments
    and are ignored.  Unrecognized tokens will generate an error and
    no processing will be done.  There is an almost one-to-one
    correspondence between file keywords and equivalent command-line
    options.  For options that require a string, the string can be
    double-quoted ("..."), and these <b>must</b> be quoted if they
    contain white-space.

    <p>
    The command input can either come from a file, or from the
    command-line arguments, but not both.

    <p>
    Overall, the input logically contains three levels of directives:

    <p>
    Header Block<br>
    Source Block<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Placement Block]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>
    [...]

    <p>
    The Header Block contains a mandatory output file specification
    line, and optional additional lines.  The Source Block contains a
    reference to a source file, and may contain zero or more Placement
    Blocks, which identify a particular cell from that file.  The
    specification must contain at least one Source Block.

    <p>
    Indentation can be used in the specification file to highlight the
    scoping.  The same logic applies in an argument list, but may be
    less visible since all options appear in one line.

    <a name="header"></a>
    <h2>Header Block</h2>

    The Header Block contains global directives.  This must be
    followed by at least one Source Block, which specifies an input
    source.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>OutFile</tt> <i>out_file_name</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-o</tt> <i>out_file_name</i>)<dd>
    This line or option is mandatory, and provides the name of the
    file to be used for output.  This must appear before any Source
    Blocks.  The output file name <b>must</b> have a recognized
    extension that corresponds to the format to be used.  These are:
    <table border = 0 cellpadding=2>
    <tr><td>CGX</td>     <td><tt>.cgx</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>CIF</td>     <td><tt>.cif</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>GDSII</td>   <td><tt>.gds, .str, .strm, .stream</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>OASIS</td>   <td><tt>.oas</tt></td></tr>
    </table>
    Only these extensions are recognized, however CGX and GDSII allow
    an additional <tt>.gz</tt> which will imply compression.

    <p>
    Basic defaults for the various output formats are as specified in
    the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export Control</b></a> panel
    from the <b>Convert Menu</b>, or from the corresponding variables.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LogFile</tt> <i>logfile</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-log</tt> <i>logfile</i>)<dd>
    This specifies the name of a log file which is produced during the
    run.  This will record messages, warnings, and errors that are
    emitted.  If not given, a log will be written using a default file
    name, which is "<tt>assemble.log</tt>" in the current directory,
    for the <b>!assemble</b> command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>TopCell</tt> <i>cellname</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-t</tt> <i>cellname</i>)<dd>
    This optional line or option specifies that a new top-level cell
    is to be created in output.  At most one <tt>TopCell</tt> can be
    given.  This must appear before any Source Block.

    <p>
    If a <tt>TopCell</tt> is given, a corresponding cell definition
    will be created in the output file, and all cells specified in
    Placement Blocks (the "placements") will be instantiated in the
    new cell.  Whether or not a <tt>TopCell</tt> is given, the
    placements will be streamed to the output file, meaning that the
    cell definitions needed to describe the cell and possibly its
    hierarchy will be added to the output file.  With a
    <tt>TopCell</tt> given, the placements will be instantiated in
    the new top cell in output.  Otherwise, there is no placement, and
    redundant Placement Blocks will be ignored.  The output file can
    end up with multiple top-level cells, which may be desirable when
    creating a library.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The Header can also contain any of the Source Block or Placement
    Block directives below.  These will be used as defaults in all
    blocks that follow, but can be overridden from within the blocks,
    or set, modified, or reset between Source Blocks.

    <a name="source"></a>
    <h2>Source Blocks</h2>

    The Source Blocks specify an input file or CHD, and provide
    directives that are active when the source is read.  The Source
    Block may contain Placement Blocks, which identify individual
    cells or cell hierarchies to be read.

    <p>
    The same file might be used in more than one Source Block, if the
    directives, such as cell name modification, are different in the
    two blocks.

    <p>
    The Source Blocks start with the following keyword:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Source</tt> <i>filename</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-i</tt> <i>filename</i>)<dd>
    This line or option represents the start of a Source Block for the
    given input file.  The file must be in one of the supported
    archive formats, and the format is recognized automatically, so
    there is no name suffix requirement as with the output file name.

    <p>
    The absence of any Placement Blocks defined in the Source Block
    implies that all cells found in the file will be read.

    <p>
    The <i>filename</i> can also be the access name of a <a
    href="xic:hier">CHD</a> which already exists in memory.  In this
    case, the CHD is used for access, and cell names given in
    Placement Blocks must include any cell name mapping which is used
    in the CHD.

    <p>
    Further, the <i>filename</i> can be that of a CHD saved to disk,
    such a with the <b>Save</b> button in the <b>Cell Hierarchy
    Digests</b> panel.  In this case, the CHD will be read into
    memory, and used as the source.

    <p>
    In any case where a Source Block contains a Placement Block, a
    temporary CHD will be created anyway if one is not given, so
    explicitly naming the CHD may save time/space in some cases.

    <p>
    In cases where a CHD is named, but no Placement Blocks are given,
    the hierarchy of the CHD's default cell will be streamed.  The
    default cell is the first top-level cell found in the file, or can
    be <a href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> into the CHD.
    </dl>

    The Source Blocks can be terminated with:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>EndSource</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-i-</tt>)<dd>
    This optional keyword or option terminates the present Source
    Block.  Lines or text tokens that follow, up to another
    <tt>Source</tt> keyword or <tt>-i</tt> option, are taken in the
    context of the Header Block.  Thus, directives can be set,
    modified, or reset between Source Blocks, and will remain in force
    (in the Header Block context) until reset or modified between
    subsequent Source Blocks.  This keyword is optional, as it is
    implicit if another <tt>Source</tt> line or <tt>-i</tt> option is
    given.  It is required only if one wishes to change the directives
    in the Header context for subsequent Source Blocks.
    </dl>

    Within the Source Block, one may find Placement Blocks, Source
    Block directives, and Placement Block directives.

    <a name="sbcmds"></a>
    <h2>Source Block Directives</h2>

    The Source Block directives can be given in the context of the
    Header Block, in which case they serve as defaults for the Source
    Blocks that follow.  They can also be given in a Source Block, in
    which case they apply in that Source Block only, and override a
    similar directive active from a definition in the Header Block
    context.  The term "Header Block context" means that the
    definition appears before any Source Block, or after an
    <tt>EndSource</tt> line (<tt>-i-</tt> option) but before the next
    <tt>Source</tt> line (<tt>-i</tt> option).

    <p>
    The Source Block directives can not appear inside of Placement
    Blocks, where they would have no meaning.  Thus, in a Source
    Block, Source Block directives can appear before the Placement
    Blocks, or between <tt>EndPlace</tt> lines (<tt>-c-</tt> option)
    and the next <tt>Place</tt> (<tt>-c</tt> option) or
    <tt>PlaceTop</tt> line (<tt>-ctop</tt> option).  The directives
    that apply are those logically in force at the end of the Source
    Block.  The Source Block directives apply to the Source Block, and
    will have the same effect for all contained Placement Blocks,
    regardless of ordering.

    <p>
    The following lines define Source Block directives:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LayerList</tt> <i>list_of_layer_names</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-l</tt> <i>list_of_layer_names</i>)<dd>
    This saves a list of space-separated <a href="layername">layer
    names</a> or hex-encoded pseudo-names to be used with the layer
    filtering directives <tt>OnlyLayers</tt> (<tt>-n</tt> option) and
    <tt>SkipLayers</tt> (<tt>-k</tt> option).  This directive in
    itself does not alter output.  This list is implied when a
    <i>list_of_layer_names</i> is provided with these keywords.  In
    the command line, the list of layer names must be quoted if it
    contains more than one entry, but this is not required in a file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>OnlyLayers</tt> [<i>list_of_layer_names</i>]<br>
    (option: <tt>-n</tt>)<dd>
    When active, only the listed layers will be used in output,
    geometry on other layers will be skipped.  Arguments following
    this keyword will be used to set or reset the <tt>LayerList</tt>,
    and have the same interpretation as for that keyword.  If no
    arguments follow, the <tt>LayerList</tt> currently in scope will
    be used.  The <tt>-n</tt> command line token <i>does not</i>
    accept a list of layer names, unlike the corresponding keyword. 
    This must be separately specified with a <tt>-l</tt> option.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoOnlyLayers</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-n-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off restriction to layers in the <tt>LayerList</tt>, if the
    <tt>OnlyLayers</tt> directive (<tt>-n</tt> option) is in force. 
    The corresponding <tt>LayerList</tt> remains defined.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>SkipLayers</tt> [<i>list_of_layer_names</i>]<br>
    (option: <tt>-k</tt>)<dd>
    When active, listed layers will not appear in output, geometry on
    layers not listed will appear in output.  Arguments following this
    keyword will be used to set or reset the <tt>LayerList</tt>, and
    have the same interpretation as for that keyword.  If no arguments
    follow, the <tt>LayerList</tt> currently in scope will be used. 
    The <tt>-k</tt> command line token <i>does not</i> accept a list
    of layer names, unlike the corresponding keyword.  This must be
    separately specified with a <tt>-l</tt> option.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoSkipLayers</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-k-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off layer skipping, if the <tt>SkipLayers</tt> directive
    (<tt>-k</tt> option) is currently in force.  The associated
    <tt>LayerList</tt> remains defined.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LayerAliases</tt> <i>name1</i>=<i>alias1</i>
      <i>name2</i>=<i>alias2</i> ...<br>
    (option: <tt>-a</tt> <i>name1</i>=<i>alias1</i>
      <i>name2</i>=<i>alias2</i> ...)<dd>
    This keyword provides a list a layer aliasing definitions to apply
    in output.  The layer names can be hex-encoded pseudo-names when
    applicable.  This is similar to the <a href="layerchange">layer
    aliasing</a> found in the <b>Format Conversion</b> panel and
    elsewhere.  In the command line, the list must be quoted if it
    contains more than one entry, but this is not required in a file. 
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ConvertScale</tt> <i>scale_factor</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-cs</tt> <i>scale_factor</i>)<dd>
    This directive has effect only in the case where there are no
    Placement Blocks, and is ignored otherwise.  This will scale all
    coordinates read from the source by the given factor, which can be
    in the range 0.001 through 1000.0.  Thus, in output, the
    corresponding cell definitions will be scaled by this factor. 
    This is similar to the <tt>Scale</tt> Placement Block directive
    (<tt>-s</tt> option), but applies when there are no Placement
    Blocks and Placement Block directives are ignored.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ToLower</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-tlo</tt>)<dd>
    This sets a flag to indicate conversion of upper case cell names
    to lower case in output.  Mixed-case cell names are unaffected.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoToLower</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-tlo-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off lower-casing, if the <tt>ToLower</tt> directive
    (<tt>-tlo</tt> option) is currently in force.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ToUpper</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-tup</tt>)<dd>
    This sets a flag to indicate conversion of lower case cell names
    to upper case.  Mixed-case cell names are unaffected.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoToUpper</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-tup-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off upper-casing, if the <tt>ToUpper</tt> directive
    (<tt>-tup</tt> option) is currently in force.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>CellNamePrefix</tt> <i>prefix_string</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-p</tt> <i>prefix_string</i>)<dd>
    Cell name change prefix.  This operation occurs after case
    conversion.  The <i>prefix_string</i> is interpreted in the manner
    of the <a href="InCellNamePrefix"><b>InCellNamePrefix</b></a>
    variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>CellNameSuffix</tt> <i>suffix_string</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-u</tt> <i>suffix_string</i>)<dd>
    Cell name change suffix.  This operation occurs after case
    conversion.  The <i>suffix_string</i> is interpreted in the manner
    of the <a href="InCellNameSuffix"><b>InCellNameSuffix</b></a>
    variable.
    </dl>

    <a name="place"></a>
    <h2>Placement Blocks</h2>

    Placement Blocks can appear only within Source Blocks.  Each
    Source Block can have zero or more Placement Blocks.  If no
    Placement Blocks are given, all cells in the source file are
    written to output, and Placement Block directives that may be in
    force are ignored.  If the Source Block specifies a CHD source,
    absent any Placement Blocks, the hierarchy of the CHD's default
    cell will be streamed to output.

    <p>
    A Placement Block is used to indicate a specific cell within the
    source file, which will be written to output.  The Placement Block
    directives specify actions to take, for example whether to process
    just this cell or its hierarchy, whether to use flattening and/or
    windowing, and the placement transform if the cell is to be
    instantiated in a given <tt>TopCell</tt>.

    <p>
    As cells are written to output, a table is maintained to prevent
    writing duplicate cell definitions.  Each cell needed to represent
    the cell hierarchies contained in the output file is written once
    only.  When different versions of the same cell are needed, such
    as with different scaling, the names of the cells are altered to
    avoid a name clash.  This is accomplished by appending
    "<tt>$</tt><i>N</i>", where <i>N</i> is an integer which makes the
    new name unique, to the cell names.

    <p>
    A new Placement Block, which can appear only within a Source
    Block, will begin with either of the following keywords or
    options:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Place</tt> <i>cellname</i> [<i>placement_name</i>]<br>
    (option: <tt>-c</tt> <i>cellname</i>)<dd>
    The <i>cellname</i>, which must name a cell in the source file,
    will be included in the output file.  If a <tt>TopCell</tt> was
    given, the cell will also be instantiated in the given top cell. 
    The <i>placement_name</i>, if given, will replace <i>cellname</i>
    in output.  In either case, any cell name alteration presently in
    force will be applied.  If a Placement Block matches a previous
    block except for the transformation parameters
    (<tt>Translate</tt>, <tt>Rotate</tt>, <tt>Magnify</tt>,
    <tt>Reflect</tt>), then if a <tt>TopCell</tt> was given, an
    instance will be added with the new transform, but the cell
    definitions are already in the output and will not be streamed. 
    Thus, in this case with no <tt>TopCell</tt>, there would be no
    addition to output.

    <p>
    In a command line, the <i>placement_name</i> can not follow the
    <i>cellname</i> as in a file.  Rather, there is a special option
    token
    <blockquote>
    <tt>-ca</tt> <i>placement_name</i>
    </blockquote>
    that can appear within the Placement Block which specifies the
    name change.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>PlaceTop</tt> [<i>placement_name</i>]<br>
    (option: <tt>-ctop</tt>)<dd>
    The <tt>PlaceTop</tt> line (<tt>-ctop</tt> option) is equivalent
    to a <tt>Place</tt> line (<tt>-c</tt> option), except that it will
    automatically select the first top-level cell found in the source. 
    It is equivalent to the <tt>Place</tt> line (<tt>-c</tt> option)
    with the name of this cell as the first (only) argument.  This is
    convenient when the top-level cell name is unknown.  Unlike the
    keyword, the <tt>-ctop</tt> option does not take a following
    <i>placement_name</i>, which must be given by a <tt>-ca</tt> option
    within the Placement Block.
    </dl>

    A Placement Block can be terminated with:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>PlaceEnd</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-c-</tt>)<dd>
    This optional keyword will end the current Placement Block. 
    Subsequent lines will be accepted in the scope of the containing
    Source Block.  This keyword is optional, as it is implicit if a
    <tt>Place</tt> or <tt>PlaceTop</tt> keyword (<tt>-c</tt> or
    <tt>-ctop</tt> option) is given.  It is useful if one needs to
    add, modify, or reset Placement Block directives in the Source
    Block scope, which will apply to subsequent Placement Blocks.
    </dl>

    <p>
    A Placement Block may contain any of the Placement Block
    directives, which control how the cell is treated in output.  The
    transformations apply only when a <tt>TopCell</tt> was given in
    the Header Block, and control the location and orientation of the
    instantiation.

    <a name="pbcmds"></a>
    <h2>Placement Block Directives</h2>

    The Placement Block directives can appear in the Header Block
    context, the Source Block context, or within a Placement Block. 
    Thus, they can appear virtually anywhere in the specification file
    or command line, though the location alters the scope.

    <p>
    If given in the Header Block context, meaning that the directive
    appears before the first Source Block, or after an
    <tt>EndSource</tt> line (<tt>-i-</tt> option) but ahead of the
    next <tt>Source</tt> line (<tt>-i</tt> option), then the directive
    will be active as a default in all Source Blocks that follow,
    until the directive is changed or reset in the Header Block
    context.

    <p>
    Similarly, if a Placement Block directive is given in a Source
    Block, it will override a similar directive set in the Header
    Block scope, and will apply to all Placement Blocks that follow
    within the Source Block, until changed or reset in the context of
    the same Source Block.  Being given in a Source Block, or in the
    context of a Source Block, means that the directive appears before
    the first <tt>Place</tt> or <tt>PlaceTop</tt> line (<tt>-c</tt> or
    <tt>-ctop</tt> option), or after an <tt>EndPlace</tt> line
    (<tt>-c-</tt> option) but before the next <tt>Place</tt> or
    <tt>PlaceTop</tt> line or equivalent options.

    <p>
    If the Placement Block directive appears within a Placement Block,
    it will override a similar directive set in the Source Block or
    Header Block, and will apply to the current Placement Block only.

    <p>
    Placement Block directives are ignored when reading a source that
    has no Placement Blocks.

    <p>
    The following directives define the transformation applied to an
    instantiation of the cell in the <tt>TopCell</tt>.  These will be
    ignored unless a <tt>TopCell</tt> was given.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Translate</tt> <i>x y</i><br>
    (options: <tt>-x</tt> <i>x</i> <tt>-y</tt> <i>y</i>)<dd>
    Specify the translation coordinates.  If not given, the default is
    0, 0.  Note that the keyword corresponds to two command-line
    options.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <td><tt>Rotate</tt> <i>angle</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-ang</tt> <i>angle</i>)<dd>
    Specify a rotation angle, which must be a multiple of 45 degrees. 
    If not given, the default is no rotation.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <td><tt>Magnify</tt> <i>magn</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-m</tt> <i>magn</i>)<dd>
    Specify an instance magnification.  If not given, the default is 1.0.
    Values from .001 to 1000.0 are accepted.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Reflect</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-my</tt>)<dd>
    Apply a mirror-Y transformation (before rotation, if any).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoReflect</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-my-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off the mirror-Y transformation, if the <tt>Reflect</tt>
    directive (<tt>-my</tt> option) is currently in force.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The following directives initiate operations on the cell
    definition, as it is written to output.  These are performed
    whether or not a <tt>TopCell</tt> was defined.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Scale</tt> <i>scale_factor</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-s</tt> <i>scale_factor</i>)<dd>
    The cells read from the source will have all coordinates
    multiplied by the scale factor, which can be in the range .001 -
    1000.0.  This is distinct from the <tt>Magnify</tt> factor, which
    applies only to the instance created in the <tt>TopCell</tt>, and
    will in effect multiply the scale factor.  When there are no
    Placement Blocks, and so Placement Block directives are ignored,
    the <tt>ConvertScale</tt> Source Block directive (<tt>-cs</tt>
    option) can be used to obtain the same effect.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoHier</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-h</tt>)<dd>
    If given, only the specified cell is written to output, and not
    its complete hierarchy as is the normal case.  This can produce
    output files with unresolved subcell references, which must be
    satisfied by some means.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoNoHier</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-h-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off the no-hierarchy mode, if the <tt>NoHier</tt> directive
    (<tt>-h</tt> option) is currently in force.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoEmpties [<i>N</i>]</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-e[<i>N</i>]</tt>)<dd>
    These enable various permutations of the empty cell filtering
    operations, as <a href="ecfilt">described</a> for the
    <b>Format Conversion</b> panel.  These are:
    <dl>
    <dt>"<tt>NoEmpties</tt>" or "<tt>NoEmpties 1</tt>"<br>
    (option: "<tt>-e</tt>" or "<tt>-e1</tt>")<dd>
    Turn on both pre- and post-filtering.
    <dt>"<tt>NoEmpties 2</tt>"<br>
    (option: "<tt>-e2</tt>")<dd>
    Turn on pre-filtering only.
    <dt>"<tt>NoEmpties 3</tt>"<br>
    (option: "<tt>-e3</tt>")<dd>
    Turn on post-filtering only.
    <dt>"<tt>NoNoEmpties</tt>" or "<tt>NoEmpties 0</tt>"<br>
    (option: "<tt>-e-</tt>" or "<tt>-e0</tt>")<dd>
    Turn off all empty cell filtering.
    </dl>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoNoEmpties</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-e-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off empty cell filtering, if the <tt>NoEmpties</tt> directive
    (<tt>-e</tt> option) is currently in force (above).  These have
    synonyms "<tt>NoEmpties 0</tt>" and "<tt>-e0</tt>".
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Flatten</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-f</tt>)<dd>
    If given, all geometry under the cell being read will be written
    as part of the cell being read, i.e., the cell hierarchy will be
    flattened.  The <tt>NoHier</tt> directive (<tt>-h</tt> option) is
    ignored if this is active.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoFlatten</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-f-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off flattening, if the <tt>Flatten</tt> directive (<tt>-f</tt>
    option) is currently in force.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Window</tt> <i>left bottom right top</i><br>
    (option: <tt>-w</tt> <i>left</i>,<i>bottom</i>,<i>right</i>,<i>top</i>)<dd>
    If given, only the subcells (if <tt>NoHier</tt> is not active) and
    objects needed to describe the given area in the cell being placed
    will be written.  The coordinates apply to <i>cellname</i> after
    any scaling is applied, and are given in microns.  The four
    numbers can be separated by commas and/or white space.  In the
    command line, if white space is present between numbers, the four
    numbers must be quoted.  but this is not required in a file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Clip</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-cl</tt>)<dd>
    If <tt>Window</tt> was given, this will cause geometry to be
    clipped to the window.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoClip</tt><br>
    (option: <tt>-cl-</tt>)<dd>
    Turn off clipping, if the <tt>Clip</tt> directive (<tt>-cl</tt>
    option) is currently in force.

!!LATEX !assemble bangcmds.tex>>
\begin{quote}
Syntax: {\vt !assemble} {\it specfile} | {\it argument\_list}
\end{quote}
The {\cb !assemble} command automates reading of cells from archives,
subsequent processing, and writing to a new archive file.  It provides
the capabilities of the {\cb Format Conversion} panel in the {\cb
Convert Menu}, such as format translation, windowing, and flattening. 
Additionally, multiple input files and cells can be processed and
merged into a larger archive, on-the-fly or by using a Cell Hierarchy
Digest (CHD) so as to avoid memory limitations.  Cell definitions for
the read and possibly modified cells are streamed into the output
file, and the output file can contain a new top-level cell in which
the cells read are instantiated.  The input and output can be any of
the supported archive formats, in any combination.

The operation can be controlled by a specification script file, the
path to which is given as the argument.  The script uses a language
that is unique to this command, which will be described.  This
supplies the output file name and the description of the top-level
cell (if any), the files to be used as input, the cells to extract
from these files, and the operations to perform.  It is a simple text
file, prepared by the user, containing a number of keywords with
values.  The specification script can also be obtained from the {\cb
Assemble} command in the {\cb Convert Menu}, which is a graphical
front-end to the {\cb !assemble} command.

Alternatively, the argument list can consist of a series of option
tokens and values.  These are logically almost equivalent to the
language of the specification file.  This gives the user the option to
enter job descriptions entirely from the command line.  These
command-line options start with a `{\vt -}' character.  If the first
argument given starts with `{\vt -}', a list of option arguments is
assumed, otherwise the argument is taken as a file name.  If the
specification file name starts with `{\vt -}', one should prepend the
name with ``{\vt ./}'' to avoid a parse error.

Only physical data are read, electrical data will be stripped in
output.  A log file is produced when the {\cb !assemble} command is
run.  If not explicitly set with a {\vt LogFile}/{\vt -log}
specification, this is named ``{\vt assemble.log}'' and is written in
the current directory.  The log file contains warning and error
messages emitted by the readers during file processing, and should be
consulted if a problem occurs.

\subsubsection{File and Option Argument Format}

The {\cb !assemble} command parses and executes a specification file
or option list in the format described below.  The file text contains
keyword directives and values which specify the operations to be
performed.  Each active line begins with a keyword, and all keywords
are case-insensitive.  Blank lines and lines that begin with non-alpha
characters are taken as comments and are ignored.  Unrecognized tokens
will generate an error and no processing will be done.  There is an
almost one-to-one correspondence between file keywords and equivalent
command-line options.  For options that require a string, the string
can be double-quoted ({\vt "..."}), and these {\bf must} be quoted if
they contain white-space.

The command input can either come from a file, or from the
command-line arguments, but not both.

Overall, the input logically contains three levels of directives:

\begin{quote}
Header Block\\
Source Block\\
\hspace*{3em}{\vt [}Placement Block{\vt ]}\\
\hspace*{3em}{\vt [...]}\\
{\vt [...]}
\end{quote}

The Header Block contains a mandatory output file specification line,
and optional additional lines.  The Source Block contains a reference
to a source file, and may contain zero or more Placement Blocks, which
identify a particular cell from that file.  The specification must
contain at least one Source Block.

Indentation can be used in the specification file to highlight the
scoping.  The same logic applies in an argument list, but may be less
visible since all options appear in one line.

\subsubsection{Header Block}

The Header Blocks contains global directives.  This must be followed
by at least one Source Block, which specifies an input source.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt OutFile} {\it out\_file\_name}\\
(option: {\vt -o} {\it out\_file\_name})\\
This line or option is mandatory, and provides the name of the file to
be used for output.  This must appear before any Source Blocks.  The
output file name {\bf must} have a recognized extension that
corresponds to the format to be used.  These are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
CGX   & \vt .cgx\\
CIF   & \vt .cif\\
GDSII & \vt .gds, .str, .strm, .stream\\
OASIS & \vt .oas\\
\end{tabular}

Only these extensions are recognized, however CGX and GDSII allow an
additional {\vt .gz} which will imply compression.

Basic defaults for the various output formats are as specified in the
{\cb Export Control} panel from the {\cb Convert Menu}, or from
the corresponding variables.

\item{\vt LogFile} {\it logfile}\\
(option: {\vt -log} {\it logfile})\\
This specifies the name of a log file which is produced during the
run.  This will record messages, warnings, and errors that are
emitted.  If not given, a log will be written using a default file
name, which is ``{\vt assemble.log}'' in the current directory, for
the {\cb !assemble} command.

\item{\vt TopCell} {\it cellname}\\
(option: {\vt -t} {\it cellname})\\
This optional line or option specifies that a new top-level cell is to
be created in output.  At most one {\vt TopCell} can be given.  This
must appear before any Source Block.

If a {\vt TopCell} is given, a corresponding cell definition will be
created in the output file, and all cells specified in Placement
Blocks (the ``placements'') will be instantiated in the new cell. 
Whether or not a {\vt TopCell} is given, the placements will be
streamed to the output file, meaning that the cell definitions needed
to describe the cell and possibly its hierarchy will be added to the
output file.  With a {\vt TopCell} given, the placements will be
instantiated in the new top cell in output.  Otherwise, there is no
placement, and redundant Placement Blocks will be ignored.  The output
file can end up with multiple top-level cells, which may be desirable
when creating a library.
\end{description}

The Header can also contain any of the Source Block or Placement Block
directives below.  These will be used as defaults in all blocks that
follow, but can be overridden from within the blocks, or set,
modified, or reset between Source Blocks.

\subsubsection{Source Blocks}

The Source Blocks specify an input file or CHD, and provide directives
that are active when the source is read.  The Source Block may contain
Placement Blocks, which identify individual cells or cell hierarchies
to be read.

The same file might be used in more than one Source Block, if the
directives, such as cell name modification, are different in the two
blocks.

The Source Blocks start with the following keyword:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt Source} {\it filename}\\
(option: {\vt -i} {\it filename})\\
This line or option represents the start of a Source Block for the
given input file.  The file must be in one of the supported archive
formats, and the format is recognized automatically, so there is no
name suffix requirement as with the output file name.

The absence of any Placement Blocks defined in the Source Block
implies that all cells found in the file will be read.

The {\it filename} can also be the access name of a CHD which already
exists in memory.  In this case, the CHD is used for access, and cell
names given in Placement Blocks must include any cell name mapping
which is used in the CHD.

Further, the {\it filename} can be that of a CHD saved to disk, such a
with the {\cb Save} button in the {\cb Cell Hierarchy Digests} panel. 
In this case, the CHD will be read into memory, and used as the
source.

In any case where a Source Block contains a Placement Block, a
temporary CHD will be created anyway if one is not given, so
explicitly naming the CHD may save time/space in some cases.

In cases where a CHD is named, but no Placement Blocks are given, the
hierarchy of the CHD's default cell will be streamed.  The default
cell is the first top-level cell found in the file, or can be
configured into the CHD.
\end{description}

The Source Blocks can be terminated with:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt EndSource}\\
(option: {\vt -i-})\\
This optional keyword or option terminates the present Source Block. 
Lines or text tokens that follow, up to another {\vt Source} keyword
or {\vt -i} option, are taken in the context of the Header Block. 
Thus, directives can be set, modified, or reset between Source Blocks,
and will remain in force (in the Header Block context) until reset or
modified between subsequent Source Blocks.  This keyword is optional,
as it is implicit if another {\vt Source} line or {\vt -i} option is
given.  It is required only if one wishes to change the directives in
the Header context for subsequent Source Blocks. 
\end{description}

Within the Source Block, one may find Placement Blocks, Source Block
directives, and Placement Block directives.

\subsubsection{Source Block Directives}

The Source Block directives can be given in the context of the Header
Block, in which case they serve as defaults for the Source Blocks that
follow.  They can also be given in a Source Block, in which case they
apply in that Source Block only, and override a similar directive
active from a definition in the Header Block context.  The term
``Header Block context'' means that the definition appears before any
Source Block, or after an {\vt EndSource} line ({\vt -i-} option) but
before the next {\vt Source} line ({\vt -i} option.

The Source Block directives can not appear inside of Placement Blocks,
where they would have no meaning.  Thus, in a Source Block, Source
Block directives can appear before the Placement Blocks, or between
{\vt EndPlace} lines ({\vt -c-} option) and the next {\vt Place} ({\vt
-c} option) or {\vt PlaceTop} line ({\vt -ctop} option).  The
directives that apply are those logically in force at the end of the
Source Block.  The Source Block directives apply to the Source Block,
and will have the same effect for all contained Placement Blocks,
regardless of ordering.

The following lines define Source Block directives:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt LayerList} {\it list\_of\_layer\_names}\\
(option: {\vt -l} {\it list\_of\_layer\_names})\\
This saves a list of space-separated layer names or hex-encoded
pseudo-names to be used with the layer filtering directives {\vt
OnlyLayers} ({\vt -n} option) and {\vt SkipLayers} ({\vt -k} option). 
This directive in itself does not alter output.  This list is implied
when a {\it list\_of\_layer\_names} is provided with these keywords. 
In the command line, the list of layer names must be quoted if it
contains more than one entry, but this is not required in a file.

\item{\vt OnlyLayers} [{\it list\_of\_layer\_names\/}]\\
(option: {\vt -n})\\
When active, only the listed layers will be used in output, geometry
on other layers will be skipped.  Arguments following this keyword
will be used to set or reset the {\vt LayerList}, and have the same
interpretation as for that keyword.  If no arguments follow, the {\vt
LayerList} currently in scope will be used.  The {\vt -n} command line
token {\it does not} accept a list of layer names, unlike the
corresponding keyword.  This must be separately specified with a {\vt
-l} option.

\item{\vt NoOnlyLayers}\\
(option: {\vt -n-})\\
Turn off restriction to layers in the {\vt LayerList}, if the {\vt
OnlyLayers} directive ({\vt -n} option) is in force.  The
corresponding {\vt LayerList} remains defined.

\item{\vt SkipLayers} [{\it list\_of\_layer\_names\/}]\\
(option: {\vt -k})\\
When active, listed layers will not appear in output, geometry on
layers not listed will appear in output.  Arguments following this
keyword will be used to set or reset the {\vt LayerList}, and have the
same interpretation as for that keyword.  If no arguments follow, the
{\vt LayerList} currently in scope will be used.  The {\vt -k} command
line token {\it does not} accept a list of layer names, unlike the
corresponding keyword.  This must be separately specified with a {\vt
-l} option.

\item{\vt NoSkipLayers}\\
(option: {\vt -k-})\\
Turn off layer skipping, if the {\vt SkipLayers} directive ({\vt -k}
option) is currently in force.  The associated {\vt LayerList} remains
defined.

\item{\vt LayerAliases} {\it name1\/}={\it alias1}
  {\it name2\/}={\it alias2} ...\\
(option: {\vt -a} {\it name1\/}={\it alias1}
  {\it name2\/}={\it alias2} ...)\\
This keyword provides a list a layer aliasing definitions to apply in
output.  The layer names can be hex-encoded pseudo-names when
applicable.  This is similar to the layer aliasing found in the {\cb
Format Conversion} panel and elsewhere.  In the command line, the list
must be quoted if it contains more than one entry, but this is not
required in a file.

\item{\vt ConvertScale} {\it scale\_factor}\\
(option: {\vt -cs} {\it scale\_factor})\\
This directive has effect only in the case where there are no
Placement Blocks, and is ignored otherwise.  This will scale all
coordinates read from the source by the given factor, which can be in
the range 0.001 through 1000.0.  Thus, in output, the corresponding
cell definitions will be scaled by this factor.  This is similar to
the {\vt Scale} Placement Block directive ({\vt -s} option), but
applies when there are no Placement Blocks and Placement Block
directive are ignored.

\item{\vt ToLower}\\
(option: {\vt -tlo})\\
This sets a flag to indicate conversion of upper case cell names to
lower case in output.  Mixed-case cell names are unaffected.

\item{\vt NoToLower}\\
(option: {\vt -tlo-})\\
Turn off lower-casing, if the {\vt ToLower} directive ({\vt -tlo}
option) is currently in force.

\item{\vt ToUpper}\\
(option: {\vt -tup})\\
This sets a flag to indicate conversion of lower case cell names to
upper case.  Mixed-case cell names are unaffected.

\item{\vt NoToUpper}\\
(option: {\vt -tup-})\\
Turn off upper-casing, if the {\vt ToUpper} directive ({\vt -tup}
option) is currently in force.

\item{\vt CellNamePrefix} {\it prefix\_string}\\
(option: {\vt -p} {\it prefix\_string})\\
Cell name change prefix.  This operation occurs after case conversion. 
The {\it prefix\_string} is interpreted in the manner of the {\et
InCellNamePrefix} variable.

\item{\vt CellNameSuffix} {\it suffix\_string}\\
(option: {\vt -u} {\it suffix\_string})\\
Cell name change suffix.  This operation occurs after case conversion. 
The {\it suffix\_string} is interpreted in the manner of the {\et
InCellNameSuffix} variable.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Placement Blocks}

Placement Blocks can appear only within Source Blocks.  Each Source
Block can have zero or more Placement Blocks.  If no Placement Blocks
are given, all cells in the source file are written to output, and
Placement Block directives that may be in force are ignored.  If the
Source Block specifies a CHD source, absent any Placement Blocks, the
hierarchy of the CHD's default cell will be streamed to output.

A Placement Block is used to indicate a specific cell within the
source file, which will be written to output.  The Placement Block
directives specify actions to take, for example whether to process
just this cell or its hierarchy, whether to use flattening and/or
windowing, and the placement transform if the cell is to be
instantiated in a given {\vt TopCell}.

As cells are written to output, a table is maintained to prevent
writing duplicate cell definitions.  Each cell needed to represent the
cell hierarchies contained in the output file is written once only. 
When different versions of the same cell are needed, such as with
different scaling, the names of the cells are altered to avoid a name
clash.  This is accomplished by appending ``{\vt \$}{\it N\/}'', where
{\it N} is an integer which makes the new name unique, to the cell
names.

A new Placement Block, which can appear only within a Source Block,
will begin with either of the following keywords or options:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt Place} {\it cellname} [{\it placement\_name\/}]\\
(option: {\vt -c} {\it cellname})\\
The {\it cellname}, which must name a cell in the source file, will be
included in the output file.  If a {\vt TopCell} was given, the cell
will also be instantiated in the given top cell.  The {\it
placement\_name}, if given, will replace {\it cellname} in output.  In
either case, any cell name alteration presently in force will be
applied.  If a Placement Block matches a previous block except for the
transformation parameters ({\vt Translate}, {\vt Rotate}, {\vt
Magnify}, {\vt Reflect}), then if a {\vt TopCell} was given, an
instance will be added with the new transform, but the cell
definitions are already in the output and will not be streamed.  Thus,
in this case with no {\vt TopCell}, there would be no addition to
output.

In a command line, the {\it placement\_name} can not follow the {\it
cellname} as in a file.  Rather, there is a special option token
\begin{quote}
{\vt -ca} {\it placement\_name}
\end{quote}
that can appear within the Placement Block which specifies the name
change.

\item{\vt PlaceTop} [{\it placement\_name\/}]\\
(option: {\vt -ctop})\\
The {\vt PlaceTop} line ({\vt -ctop} option) is equivalent to a {\vt
Place} line ({\vt -c} option), except that it will automatically
select the first top-level cell found in the source.  It is equivalent
to the {\vt Place} line ({\vt -c} option) with the name of this cell
as the first (only) argument.  This is convenient when the top-level
cell name is unknown.  Unlike the keyword, the {\vt -ctop} option does
not take a following {\it placement\_name\/}, which must be given by a
{\vt -ca} option within the Placement Block.

\end{description}

A Placement Block can be terminated with:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt PlaceEnd}\\
(option: {\vt -c-})\\
This optional keyword will end the current Placement Block. 
Subsequent lines will be accepted in the scope of the containing
Source Block.  This keyword is optional, as it is implicit if a {\vt
Place} or {\vt PlaceTop} keyword ({\vt -c} or {\vt -ctop} option) is
given.  It is useful if one needs to add, modify, or reset Placement
Block directives in the Source Block scope, which will apply to
subsequent Placement Blocks.
\end{description}

A Placement Block may contain any of the Placement Block directives,
which control how the cell is treated in output.  The transformations
apply only when a {\vt TopCell} was given in the Header Block, and
control the location and orientation of the instantiation.

\subsubsection{Placement Block Directives}

The Placement Block directives can appear in the Header Block context,
the Source Block context, or within a Placement Block.  Thus, they can
appear virtually anywhere in the specification file or command line,
though the location alters the scope.

If given in the Header Block context, meaning that the directive
appears before the first Source Block, or after an {\vt EndSource}
line ({\vt -i-} option) but ahead of the next {\vt Source} line ({\vt
-i} option), then the directive will be active as a default in all
Source Blocks that follow, until the directive is changed or reset in
the Header Block context.

Similarly, if a Placement Block directive is given in a Source Block,
it will override a similar directive set in the Header Block scope,
and will apply to all Placement Blocks that follow within the Source
Block, until changed or reset in the context of the same Source Block. 
Being given in a Source Block, or in the context of a Source Block,
means that the directive appears before the first {\vt Place} or {\vt
PlaceTop} line ({\vt -c} or {\vt -ctop} option), or after an {\vt
EndPlace} line ({\vt -c-} option but before the next {\vt Place} or
{\vt PlaceTop} line or equivalent options.

If the Placement Block directive appears within a Placement Block, it
will override a similar directive set in the Source Block or Header
Block, and will apply to the current Placement Block only.

Placement Block directives are ignored when reading a source that has
no Placement Blocks.

The following directives define the transformation applied to an
instantiation of the cell in the {\vt TopCell}.  These will be ignored
unless a {\vt TopCell} was given.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt Translate} {\it x y}\\
(options: {\vt -x} {\it x} {\vt -y} {\it y})\\
Specify the translation coordinates.  If not given, the default is 0,
0.  Note that the keyword corresponds to two command-line options.

\item{\vt Rotate} {\it angle}\\
(option: {\vt -ang} {\it angle})\\
Specify a rotation angle, which must be a multiple of 45 degrees.  If
not given, the default is no rotation.

\item{\vt Magnify} {\it magn}\\
(option: {\vt -m} {\it magn})\\
Specify an instance magnification.  If not given, the default is 1.0. 
Values from .001 to 1000.0 are accepted.

\item{\vt Reflect}\\
(option: {\vt -my})\\
Apply a mirror-Y transformation (before rotation, if any).

\item{\vt NoReflect}\\
(option: {\vt -my-})\\
Turn off the mirror-Y transformation, if the {\vt Reflect} directive
({\vt -my} option) is currently in force.
\end{description}

The following directives initiate operations on the cell definition,
as it is written to output.  These are performed whether or not a {\vt
TopCell} was defined.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt Scale} {\it scale\_factor}\\
(option: {\vt -s} {\it scale\_factor})\\
The cells read from the source will have all coordinates multiplied by
the scale factor, which can be in the range .001 -- 1000.0.  This is
distinct from the {\vt Magnify} factor, which applies only to the
instance created in the {\vt TopCell}, and will in effect multiply the
scale factor.  When there are no Placement Blocks, and so Placement
Block directives are ignored, the {\vt ConvertScale} Source Block
directive ({\vt -cs} option) can be used to obtain the same effect.

\item{\vt NoHier}\\
(option: {\vt -h})\\
If given, only the specified cell is written to output, and not its
complete hierarchy as is the normal case.  This can produce output
files with unresolved subcell references, which must be satisfied by
some means.

\item{\vt NoNoHier}\\
(option: {\vt -h-})\\
Turn off the no-hierarchy mode, if the {\vt NoHier} directive ({\vt
-h} option) is currently in force.

\item{\vt NoEmpties [{\it N\/}]}\\
(option: {\vt -e}[{\it N\/}])\\
These enable various permutations of the empty cell filtering
operations, as described for the
{\cb Format Conversion} panel in \ref{ecfilt}.  These are:

\begin{description}
\item{``{\vt NoEmpties}'' or ``{\vt NoEmpties 1}''\\
(option: ``{\vt -e}'' or ``{\vt -e1}'')}\\
Turn on both pre- and post-filtering.
\item{``{\vt NoEmpties 2}''\\
(option: ``{\vt -e2}'')}\\
Turn on pre-filtering only. 
\item{``{\vt NoEmpties 3}''\\
(option: ``{\vt -e3}'')}\\
Turn on post-filtering only.
\item{``{\vt NoNoEmpties}'' or ``{\vt NoEmpties 0}''\\
(option: ``{\vt -e-}'' or ``{\vt -e0}'')}\\
Turn off all empty cell filtering.
\end{description}

\item{\vt NoNoEmpties}\\
(option: {\vt -e-})\\
Turn off empty cell filtering, if the {\vt NoEmpties} directive ({\vt
-e} option) is currently in force (above).  These have synonyms ``{\vt
NoEmpties 0}'' and ``{\vt -e0}''.

\item{\vt Flatten}\\
(option: {\vt -f})\\
If given, all geometry under the cell being read will be written as
part of the cell being read, i.e., the cell hierarchy will be
flattened.  The {\vt NoHier} directive ({\vt -h} option) is ignored if
this is active.

\item{\vt NoFlatten}\\
(option: {\vt -f-})\\
Turn off flattening, if the {\vt Flatten} directive ({\vt -f} option)
is currently in force.

\item{\vt Window} {\it left bottom right top}\\
(option: {\vt -w} {\it left\/},{\it bottom\/},{\it right\/},{\it top})\\
If given, only the subcells (if {\vt NoHier} is not active) and
objects needed to describe the given area in the cell being placed
will be written.  The coordinates apply to {\it cellname} after any
scaling is applied, and are given in microns.  The four numbers can be
separated by commas and/or white space.  In the command line, if white
space is present between numbers, the four numbers must be quoted,
but this is not required in a file.

\item{\vt Clip}\\
(option: {\vt -cl})\\
If {\vt Window} was given, this will cause geometry to be clipped to
the window.

\item{\vt NoClip}\\
(option: {\vt -cl-})\\
Turn off clipping, if the {\vt Clip} directive ({\vt -cl} option) is
currently in force.

      [<tt>-p</tt>]</b>

    <p>
    This command will write output files corresponding to a list of
    rectangular regions, or to the partitions of a square grid
    logically covering all or part of a specified cell in a given
    layout file.  The output files contain physical data only.  These
    files can be flat or hierarchical.

    <p>
    The arguments are as follows:

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-i</tt> <i>filename</i><dd>
    This mandatory argument specifies a path to a layout file, the
    access name of a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD)
    in memory, or a path to a saved CHD file.  This source will provide
    cell data as input.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <td><tt>-o</tt> <i>basename</i>.<i>ext</i><dd>
    This mandatory argument provides the base name of the output files
    that will be created, and the type of file to write.  There are
    generally two components of the argument, separated by a period. 
    The <i>basename</i> component may be absent, but the period must
    remain.  If the <i>basename</i> is absent, the name of the
    top-level cell being split will be used. 

    <p>
    The <i>ext</i>, which follows the period, must be one of the
    following to indicate the file format to be used for output.
    <table border = 0 cellpadding=2>
    <tr><td>CGX</td>     <td><tt>.cgx</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>CIF</td>     <td><tt>.cif</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>GDSII</td>   <td><tt>.gds, .str, .strm, .stream</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>OASIS</td>   <td><tt>.oas</tt></td></tr>
    </table>
    The GDSII and CGX extensions can be followed by "<tt>.gz</tt>",
    which will indicate <tt>gzip</tt> compression.

    <p>
    When writing a list of regions, the file names produced will have
    the form
    <blockquote>
    <i>basename</i><i>N</i>.<i>ext</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <i>N</i> is a 1-based index of the region in the order
    given.  When writing grid cells, the file names produced will have
    the form
    <blockquote>
    <i>basename</i>_<i>X</i>_<i>Y</i>.<i>ext</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are the 0-based indices of the
    corresponding grid cell (the origin is the lower-left corner).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-c</tt> <i>cellname</i><dd>
    This optional argument specifies the name of the cell to be used
    as the top-level in output.  If not given, this will be the first
    top-level cell found in the input file, or, if the input source is
    a CHD, the default cell <a href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a>
    into the CHD will be used.
    </dl>

    Exactly one of the following two options must be given.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-g</tt> <i>gridsize</i><dd>
    This argument specifies the length, in microns, of the side of a
    square grid cell.  The area to be written will be tiled with a
    grid of this size, with the origin at the lower left corner.  Each
    grid cell with nonzero overlap area with the area to be written
    will have a corresponding output file produced.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-r</tt> <i>l,b,r,t</i>&nbsp;[<i>,l,b,r,t</i>]&nbsp;...<dd>
    This provides a list of rectangular regions to write, as a
    comma-separated list of coordinates in microns.  Each region is
    specified by four coordinates in the order given, with no white
    space.

    <p>
    The regions can be given with a single <tt>-r</tt> followed by any
    number of concatenated regions, as implied above.  However, any
    number of <tt>-r</tt> options with region lists can be given, the
    regions will be processed in order.  Some users may find it more
    convenient to specify the regions individually, each with a
    separate <tt>-r</tt> option.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-b</tt> <i>bloatval</i><dd>
    This optional argument specifies how much, in microns, the grid
    cells will be bloated before the write operation.  If positive,
    the grid cells will be expanded, and the files will logically
    overlap.  The value can also be negative, which will leave
    logically unwritten area between output files.

    <p>
    If a region list is specified rather than a grid, the bloating
    will be applied to each region.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-w</tt> <i>l,b,r,t</i><dd>
    This specifies a rectangular area, in the top-level cell being
    written, which will be included in the output files.  The four
    numbers are given in microns, separated by commas, with no
    intervening white space.  If not provided, the entire cell area is
    understood.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-f</tt><dd>
    If this flag is given, the output files will be flat.  All geometry
    will be contained in the top-level cell of each file.  Be aware that
    this can consume a lot of disk space.

    <p>
    If not given, the output files will maintain the hierarchy of the
    original file.  In this mode, only the geometry needed to fully
    render the area of the top-level cell corresponding to the
    (possibly bloated) grid cell area is retained.  Subcells may
    therefor contain only part of the original geometry, or may not

This command will write output files corresponding to a list of
rectangular regions, or to the partitions of a square grid logically
covering all or part of a specified cell in a given layout file.  The
output files contain physical data only.  These files can be flat or
hierarchical.

The arguments are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt -i} {\it filename}\\
This mandatory argument specifies a path to a layout file, the access
name of a Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) in memory, or a path to a saved
CHD file.  This source will provide cell data as input.

\item{\vt -o} {\it basename\/}.{\it ext}\\
This mandatory argument provides the base name of the output files
that will be created, and the type of file to write.  There are
generally two components of the argument, separated by a period.  The
{\it basename} component may be absent, but the period must remain. 
If the {\it basename} is absent, the name of the top-level cell being
split will be used.

The {\it ext\/}, which follows the period, must be one of the
following to indicate the file format to be used for output.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
CGX   & \vt .cgx\\
CIF   & \vt .cif\\
GDSII & \vt .gds, .str, .strm, .stream\\
OASIS & \vt .oas\\
\end{tabular}

The GDSII and CGX extensions can be followed by ``{\vt .gz}'', which
will indicate {\vt gzip} compression.

When writing a list of regions, the file names produced will have
the form
\begin{quote}
{\it basename\/}{\it N\/}.{\it ext}
\end{quote}
where {\it N} is a 1--based index of the region in the order given. 
When writing grid cells, the file names produced will have the form
\begin{quote}
{\it basename\/}\_{\it X\/}\_{\it Y\/}.{\it ext}
\end{quote}
where {\it X} and {\it Y} are the 0--based indices of the
corresponding grid cell (the origin is the lower-left corner).

\item{\vt -c} {\it cellname}\\
This optional argument specifies the name of the cell to be used as
the top-level in output.  If not given, this will be the first
top-level cell found in the input file, or, if the input source is a
CHD, the default cell configured into the CHD will be used.
\end{description}

Exactly one of the following two options must be provided.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt -g} {\it gridsize}\\
This argument specifies the length, in microns, of the side of a
square grid cell.  The area to be written will be tiled with a grid of
this size, with the origin at the lower left corner.  Each grid cell
with nonzero overlap area with the area to be written will have a
corresponding output file produced.

\item{\vt -r} {\it l\/},{\it b\/},{\it r\/},{\it t\/}[,{\it l\/},{\it
 b\/},{\it r\/},{\it t\/}]...\\
This provides a list of rectangular regions to write, as a
comma-separated list of coordinates in microns.  Each region is
specified by four coordinates in the order given, with no white space.

The regions can be given with a single {\vt -r} followed by any number
of concatenated regions, as implied above.  However, any number of
{\vt -r} options with region lists can be given, the regions will be
processed in order.  Some users may find it more convenient to specify
the regions individually, each with a separate {\vt -r} option.

\item{\vt -b} {\it bloatval}\\
This optional argument specifies how much, in microns, the grid cells
will be bloated before the write operation.  If positive, the grid
cells will be expanded, and the files will logically overlap.  The
value can also be negative, which will leave logically unwritten area
between output files.

If a region list is specified rather than a grid, the bloating will be
applied to each region.

\item{\vt -w} {\it l\/},{\it b\/},{\it r\/},{\it t\/}\\
This specifies a rectangular area, in the top-level cell being
written, which will be included in the output files.  The four numbers
are given in microns, separated by commas, with no intervening white
space.  If not provided, the entire cell area is understood.

\item{\vt -f}\\
If this flag is given, the output files will be flat.  All geometry
will be contained in the top-level cell of each file.  Be aware that
this can consume a lot of disk space.

If not given, the output files will maintain the hierarchy of the
original file.  In this mode, only the geometry needed to fully render
the area of the top-level cell corresponding to the (possibly bloated)
grid cell area is retained.  Subcells may therefor contain only part
of the original geometry, or may not appear at all if not instantiated
within the area.  Subcells may also become empty, these are not
automatically stripped.

\item{\vt -m}\\
If flattening, this option specifies that a suffix ``\_{\it N\/}'' is
added to the top cell name in each file, with {\it N} an integer, so
as to make the cell names unique in the collection.  This will
facilitate subsequent merging of data from the files by avoiding cell
name clashes.  Without this option, the files would have the same cell
name, the same name as the original top-level cell.  This option is
ignored if not flattening ({\vt -f} not given). 

\item{\vt -cl}\\
This flag will cause geometry to be clipped at the (possibly bloated)
grid cell boundaries.  This applies whether flattening or not.  Note
that when not flattening, clipping does not guarantee that geometry is
confined to the clip area.

\item{\vt -e}[{\it N\/}]\\
This will enable empty cell filtering, as described for the {\cb
Format Conversion} panel in \ref{ecfilt}.  The options are:
\begin{description}
\item{\vt -e} or {\vt -e1}\\
Turn on both pre- and post-filtering.
\item{\vt -e2}\\
Turn on pre-filtering only.
\item{\vt -e3}\\
Turn on post-filtering only.
\item{\vt -e0}\\
Turn off all empty cell filtering (no operation).
\end{description}

\item{\vt -p}\\
This option specifies that an alternative ``parallel'' writing
algorithm is used when creating output.  In this case, the input file
is read once only, and content is dispatched to the appropriate output
files.  The normal operation is sequential, where the input file is
scanned for each output file.  The parallel method is expected to be
faster, though results may vary. 
\end{description}

The command will create a temporary CHD, if necessary.  Each grid
region is written out sequentially, in the manner of windowing from
the {\cb Format Conversion} panel from the {\cb Convert Menu}.

    <p>
    In the design of CMOS circuits, design rules and guidelines often
    provide a limit on the area of a wire net connected to a MOS gate. 
    During processing, the wire net can act as an "antenna" which
    accumulates charge, potentially damaging the thin MOS gate oxide. 
    This command provides checking of antenna nets.

    <p>
    Note that this is part of the extraction system and not DRC.  The
    DRC system presently does not maintain a sophisticated enough
    state to identify device contacts or follow wire nets.

    <p>
    The <b>!antenna</b> command utilizes the values of the technology
    file extraction keywords <a href="Antenna"><tt>Antenna</tt></a>
    (in physical layer blocks) and <a
    href="AntennaTotal"><tt>AntennaTotal</tt></a>.  These keywords
    provide values which are used as defaults, which can be overridden
    from the command line.

    <p>
    If given without arguments, the <b>!antenna</b> command will
    generate an argument list constructed from the defaults (if any). 
    This is displayed in the prompt area, where it can be edited by
    the user.  The run begins when the user presses the <b>Enter</b>
    key.  If there are no defaults, or if an argument was given to the
    command, there is no prompt and the command runs immediately.

    <p>
    With no parameters given, the command will identify and print an
    entry for each wire net in the hierarchy of the current cell which
    connects to a MOS gate.  The results go to a file, created in the
    current directory, named <i>cellname</i><tt>.antenna.log</tt>,
    where <i>cellname</i> is the name of the current cell.  The user
    is given a chance to view this file when the operation completes.

    <p>
    The parameters provide a "filtering" function, whereby only
    entries outside of the filter range are printed in the file.  The
    filtering parameter is the ratio of wire net area to total gate
    area connected to the net.  These ratios can apply to individual
    layers contained in the wire net, or the total wire net area. 
    Only entries that exceed given parameters are printed in the log
    file.

    <p>
    For example,
    <blockquote>
    <tt>!antenna POLY 20 M1 30 50</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This will print wire nets where at least one of the following is
    true:
    <ol>
    <li>The ratio of POLY area to gate area exceeds 20.
    <li>The ratio of M1 area to gate area exceeds 30.
    <li>The ratio of total wire net area to gate area exceeds 50.
    </ol>

    <p>
    Thus, the log file will typically contain only those nets that
    exceed the guidelines.

    <p>
    These "bad" nets can be displayed in the <b>Select Path</b> mode
    of the <a href="xic:exsel"><b>Path Selection Control</b></a>
    panel.  After the <b>!antenna</b> command has been run, and/or
    with the log file in the current directory, pressing the <b>Load
    Antenna file</b> button or the <b>f</b> key will prompt for an
    antenna net number.  This is the number in the log file that
    begins the report for each net.

    <p>
    The file will be accessed, and the corresponding wire net will be
    extracted and highlighted.  The wire net is identified via the
    reference bounding box provided in the log file, on the same line
    as the net number.

In the design of CMOS circuits, design rules and guidelines often
provide a limit on the area of a wire net connected to a MOS gate. 
During processing, the wire net can act as an ``antenna'' which
accumulates charge, potentially damaging the thin MOS gate oxide. 
This command provides checking of antenna nets.

Note that this is part of the extraction system and not DRC.  The DRC
system presently does not maintain a sophisticated enough state to
identify device contacts or follow wire nets.

The {\cb !antenna} command utilizes the values of the technology file
extraction keywords {\et Antenna} (in physical layer blocks) and {\et
AntennaTotal}.  These keywords provide values which are used as
defaults, which can be overridden from the command line.

If given without arguments, the {\cb !antenna} command will generate
an argument list constructed from the defaults (if any).  This is
displayed in the prompt area, where it can be edited by the user.  The
run begins when the user presses the {\kb Enter} key.  If there are no
defaults, or if an argument was given to the command, there is no
prompt and the command runs immediately.

With no parameters given, the command will identify and print an entry
for each wire net in the hierarchy of the current cell which connects
to a MOS gate.  The results go to a file, created in the current
directory, named {\it cellname\/}{\vt .antenna.log}, where {\vt
cellname} is the name of the current cell.  The user is given a chance
to view this file when the operation completes.

The parameters provide a ``filtering'' function, whereby only entries
outside of the filter range are printed in the file.  The filtering
parameter is the ratio of wire net area to total gate area connected
to the net.  These ratios can apply to individual layers contained in
the wire net, or the total wire net area.  Only entries that exceed
given parameters are printed in the log file.
 
For example,
\begin{quote}
\vt !antenna POLY 20 M1 30 50
\end{quote}

This will print wire nets where at least one of the following is
true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The ratio of POLY area to gate area exceeds 20.}
\item{The ratio of M1 area to gate area exceeds 30.}
\item{The ratio of total wire net area to gate area exceeds 50.}
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the log file will typically contain only those nets that exceed
the guidelines.

These ``bad'' nets can be displayed in the {\cb Select Path} mode of
the {\cb Path Selection Control} panel.  After the {\cb !antenna}
command has been run, and/or with the log file in the current
directory, pressing the {\cb Load Antenna file} button or the {\kb f}
key will prompt for an antenna net number.  This is the number in the
log file that begins the report for each net.

The file will be accessed, and the corresponding wire net will be
extracted and highlighted.  The wire net is identified via the
reference bounding box provided in the log file, on the same line as
the net number.

    <p>
    <font color=red>This is an early implementation of a new
    capability.  Feedback and wish-lists from users is
    encouraged.</font>

    <p>
    The <b>!netext</b> command performs identification and extraction
    of physical wire nets from a layout.  There are a number of modes
    and features, but the final result is generally an <a
    href="oasis">OASIS</a> file containing a top-level cell with the
    same name as the original top-level cell, which contains a subcell
    for every wire net.  Each subcell contains all of the conductors
    that comprise the net, as if the original hierarchy were flat. 
    This file can be used as a starting point for further analysis,
    such as parasitic extraction using a field solver.

    <p>
    The full operation is performed in three stages.

    <a name="stage1"></a>
    <h2>Stage 1</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) in
    memory for the input file, if necessary.

    <li>Divide the area of the top-level cell into a logical grid.

    <li>For each grid area, the CHD is used to read into memory a flat
    representation of the grid area, clipped to the grid.

    <li>The wire nets for this area are identified.  This can take
    into account device structures and exclusion areas.

    <li>An OASIS file is written to disk, which contains a subcell for
    each net found.  Up to four edge-mapping files are also produced,
    one each for the edges that are shared with another grid cell. 
    These files map the parts of the edge which coincide with the edge
    of a conducting object.
    </ol>

    <p>
    At the end of Stage 1, the work area on disk contains a number of
    OASIS files, one for each grid cell, and associated edge mapping
    files.

    <p>
    Note that the grid areas are processed sequentially.  On a
    computer with limited memory, the grid size should be "small" so
    as to not exhaust available memory, but even a modest computer can
    process very large files.  Note also that in theory this stage
    could easily be accelerated by use of multiple computers.  Stage 1
    is the most compute-intensive part of the flow.

    <a name="stage2"></a>
    <h2>Stage 2</h2>

    The second stage compares the two edge files for each shared grid
    boundary, and generates an equivalence file.  The equivalence file
    maps between the nets that abut at grid boundaries.  Once the edge
    files have been processed, the edge files are deleted.

    <a name="stage3"></a>
    <h2>Stage 3</h2>

    In the final stage, the individual OASIS files for each grid cell
    are combined, using the equivalence file, into a single OASIS
    file.  There are two ways that nets that extend across grid
    boundaries can be handled.  The "easy" way is to simply copy all
    net cells from all grid areas into the output.  For the nets that
    connect to other nets, choose a "primary" subnet (cell).  In this
    cell, instantiate the other net cells to which the primary subnet
    connects.

    <p>
    The alternative is to actually copy the subnet cell geometry into
    the primary cell.  This format is easier to work with, but
    requires more time and memory to construct.

    <p>
    When the output file is written, the equivalence file and the
    Stage 1 OASIS files are deleted, and the operation is complete.

    <p>
    If a net has an assigned name in the source file, (e.g., through a
    label or from a terminal) A NXNAME property will be given to the
    created net files.  This is property number 7149, and the string
    is the net name.  This is not presently used by <i>Xic</i>, but
    the net name may be useful to the user.  Beware if using a grid: 
    if flattening, the top net cell will contain the net name
    properties from all grid cells, so there may be duplicate or
    inconsistent name properties.  If not flattening, the primary and
    all subcells should be checked, each property applies only to the
    corresponding grid location.  In either case, conflicting names
    would need to be dealt with somehow.

    <a name="args"></a>
    <h2>Command Arguments</h2>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-f</tt> <i>filename</i><dd>
      This mandatory argument specifies the input source for batch net
      extraction.  the <i>filename</i> can be a path to a layout file
      in a <a href="xic:fsaf">supported format</a>, the access name of
      a CHD in memory, or a path to a saved CHD file.

      <p>
      The <a href="techfile">technology file</a> in use must match the
      source file, with the extraction parameters and keywords
      properly <a href="ext:setup">set up</a>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-c</tt> <i>cellname</i><dd>
      This provides the name of the top-level cell for extraction.  If
      not given, the top-level cell used will be either the cell <a
      href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> into the CHD source, if any,
      or the lowest-offset top-level cell found in the source layout
      file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-g</tt> <i>gridsize</i><dd>
      if the "<tt>-w</tt>" (windowing) option is not given,
      this sets the grid size, in microns.  Use of a grid minimizes
      memory consumption for handling large designs.  For smaller
      designs gridding may not be necessary, so this option can be
      skipped or given as 0.  In this case the entire bounding box of
      the top-level cell is understood.  The OASIS file is produced,
      but there are no edge files, and no Stage 2 or Stage 3 steps.

      <p>
      The choice of a grid size is machine and layout dependent.  The
      objective is to choose as large a grid as possible, without
      exceeding memory limits or causing excessive page-swapping.  In
      general, some experimentation may be required to find the "best"
      grid size.  A starting point of 400 microns may be reasonable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-v</tt><dd>
      If given, via objects will be included in the netlist cells and
      files.  Via layers are the layers with the <a
      href=Via"><tt>Via</tt></a> keyword given in the technology file. 
      The objects on these layers are clipped to the intersection
      areas of the two associated conductors.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-v+</tt><dd>
      This is similar to <tt>-v</tt>, but in addition the "check
      layers" (if any), clipped to the via object, will also be
      included in net cells and files.  The check layers are the
      layers used in the optional layer expression supplied on the
      <tt>Via</tt> line.  This expression must be "true" for a via
      object to actually represent a connection.  With <tt>-v</tt>
      given, the included vias are those that pass the check criteria,
      but the check layers are not included.  With <tt>-v+</tt>, the
      check layers will be included.

      <p>
      If the generated netlist file is read back into <i>Xic</i> and
      extraction run, the <tt>-v+</tt> option will allow the nets to
      be correctly re-extracted.  If the check layers are missing,
      this may fail, and extraction would certainly fail if vias are
      not included at all.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-vs</tt><dd>
      When there is no windowing or gridding in use and this option is
      given, standard vias will be retained as they are rather than
      being converted to equivalent geometry.  The net cells will
      contain the standard via placements from the net, from all
      hierarchy levels, as subcells.  Presently, this requires that
      the standard via sub-masters not be included in the source
      layout file, i.e., they are created within <i>Xic</i> as the
      file is read.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-w</tt> <i>l</i>,<i>b</i>,<i>r</i>,<i>t</i><dd>
      If a window is given, a grid size should not be given and will
      be ignored.  In this case, there is no grid, and the rectangular
      area given, as comma-separated dimensions in microns, is read
      into memory and processed as if it were a grid cell.  The OASIS
      file is produced, but there are no edge files, and no Stage 2 or
      Stage 3 steps.  If all values are 0, the effective area is the
      bounding box of the top-level cell, which is the default when no
      area or grid is given.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-b</tt> <i>basename</i><dd>
      This supplies a basename for the generated files.  It can have a
      path prefix, which will cause the generated files to be written
      in the given directory, which must exist.  If this argument is
      not given, the name of the top-level cell is used as the
      basename.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-nf</tt><dd>
      By default, in Stage 3 processing, the net cells will be flat. 
      If this argument is given, subnets will appear is cell instances
      in the "primary" net cell.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-nc</tt><dd>
      This will turn off compression in OASIS output files.  This is
      not a good idea, unless compression is not supported by the
      reader.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-ne</tt><dd>
      This turns off the part of the extraction that recognizes device
      structures, leaving only conductor grouping for connectivity
      determination.  This may be fine fo some applications, and
      avoids computation.  In MOS circuits, for example, if the Active
      layer is assumed to be a conductor, then all FETs will be
      shorted, drain to source.  However, using a <a
      href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor Exclude</tt></a> directive for
      Poly on Active should fix this.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-l</tt><dd>
      If this is given, when the flat data are read into memory for
      processing, any existing layer filtering is kept.  Without this
      option, when <tt>-ne</tt> is not given, all layers are read
      since these may affect device recognition.  When <tt>-ne</tt> is
      given, only <a href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor</tt> and <a
      href="Via"><tt>Via</tt></a> layers are read.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-k</tt><dd>
      If given, all working files are retained.  Without this option,
      edge files, etc.  are deleted when no longer needed.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-s1</tt><dd>
      If given, the operation will stop at the end of Stage 1.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-s2</tt><dd>
      If given, the operation will stop ath the end of Stage 2.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The grid cells are assigned x,y index numbers, according to
    position, with the 0,0 cell located in the lower left corner.  The
    cells are traversed left to right by row, from bottom to top. 
    Each net in a grid is assigned a number, which is the group number
    from extraction.  All three numbers are non-negative, and the
    triplets represent a unique designation for a subnet.  The net
    cells in the Stage 1 OASIS files files are names "<i>x_y_n</i>",
    i.e., the three numbers separated by underscores.

    <p>
    In the final OASIS file, the net cells are renamed <tt>n1</tt>,
    <tt>n2</tt>, ..., replacing the triples with an index number.  If
    instantiation is used, the subnet cells that are not primary nets
    retain their original names.  The primary subnet from among a group
    of connected subnets is the one that is lowest in "traversal
    order", which is the lowest group number in the first grid cell
    seen in a sweep left to right in the rows, ascending in y.

PRELIMINARY -- This is the initial implementation of a new capability. 
Feedback and wish-lists from users is encouraged.

The {\cb !netext} command performs identification and extraction of
physical wire nets from a layout.  There are a number of modes and
features, but the final result is generally an OASIS file containing a
top-level cell with the same name as the original top-level cell,
which contains a subcell for every wire net.  Each subcell contains
all of the conductors that comprise the net, as if the original
hierarchy were flat.  This file can be used as a starting point for
further analysis, such as parasitic extraction using a field solver.

The full operation is performed in three stages.

\subsubsection{Stage 1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Create a Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) in memory for the input
file, if necessary.}

\item{Divide the area of the top-level cell into a logical grid.}

\item{For each grid area, the CHD is used to read into memory a flat

When the output file is written, the equivalence file and the Stage 1
OASIS files are deleted, and the operation is complete.

If a net has an assigned name in the source file, (e.g., through a

created net files.  This is property number 7149, and the string is
the net name.  This is not presently used by {\Xic}, but the net name

not flattening, the primary and all subcells should be checked, each
property applies only to the corresponding grid location.  In either
case, conflicting names would need to be dealt with somehow.

\subsubsection{Command Arguments}

\begin{description}
\item{\vt -f} {\it filename}\\
This mandatory argument specifies the input source for batch net
extraction.  the {\it filename} can be a path to a layout file in a
supported format, the access name of a CHD in memory, or a path to a
saved CHD file.

The technology file in use must match the source file, with the
extraction parameters and keywords properly set up.

\item{\vt -c} {\it cellname}\\
This provides the name of the top-level cell for extraction.  If not
given, the top-level cell used will be either the cell configured into
the CHD source, if any, or the lowest-offset top-level cell found in
the source layout file.

\item{\vt -g} {\it gridsize}\\
if the ``{\vt -w}'' (windowing) option is not given, this sets the
grid size, in microns.  Use of a grid minimizes memory consumption for
handling large designs.  For smaller designs gridding may not be
necessary, so this option can be skipped or given as 0.  In this case
the entire bounding box of the top-level cell is understood.  The
OASIS file is produced, but there are no edge files, and no Stage 2 or
Stage 3 steps.

The choice of a grid size is machine and layout dependent.  The
objective is to choose as large a grid as possible, without exceeding
memory limits or causing excessive page-swapping.  In general, some
experimentation may be required to find the ``best'' grid size.  A
starting point of 400 microns may be reasonable.

\item{\vt -v}\\
If given, via objects will be included in the netlist cells and files. 
Via layers are the layers with the {\et Via} keyword given in the
technology file.  The objects on these layers are clipped to the
intersection areas of the two associated conductors.

\item{\vt -v+}\\
This is similar to {\vt -v}, but in addition the ``check layers'' (if
any), clipped to the via object, will also be included in net cells
and files.  The check layers are the layers used in the optional layer
expression supplied on the {\vt Via} line.  This expression must be
``true'' for a via object to actually represent a connection.  With
{\vt -v} given, the included vias are those that pass the check
criteria, but the check layers are not included.  With {\vt -v+}, the
check layers will be included.

If the generated netlist file is read back into {\Xic} and extraction
run, the {\vt -v+} option will allow the nets to be correctly
re-extracted.  If the check layers are missing, this may fail, and
extraction would certainly fail if vias are not included at all.

\item{\vt -vs}\\
When there is no windowing or gridding in use and this option is
given, standard vias will be retained as they are rather than being
converted to equivalent geometry.  The net cells will contain the
standard via placements from the net, from all hierarchy levels, as
subcells.  Presently, this requires that the standard via sub-masters
not be included in the source layout file, i.e., they are created
within {\Xic} as the file is read.

\item{\vt -w} {\it l\/},{\it b\/},{\it r\/},{\it t}\\
If a window is given, a grid size should not be given and will be
ignored.  In this case, there is no grid, and the rectangular area
given, as comma-separated dimensions in microns, is read into memory
and processed as if it were a grid cell.  The OASIS file is produced,
but there are no edge files, and no Stage 2 or Stage 3 steps.  If all
values are 0, the effective area is the bounding box of the top-level
cell, which is the default when no area or grid is given.

\item{\vt -b} {\it basename}\\
This supplies a basename for the generated files.  It can have a path
prefix, which will cause the generated files to be written in the
given directory, which must exist.  If this argument is not given, the
name of the top-level cell is used as the basename.

\item{\vt -nf}\\
By default, in Stage 3 processing, the net cells will be flat.  If
this argument is given, subnets will appear is cell instances in the
``primary'' net cell.

\item{\vt -nc}\\
This will turn off compression in OASIS output files.  This is not a
good idea, unless compression is not supported by the reader.

\item{\vt -ne}\\
This turns off the part of the extraction that recognizes device
structures, leaving only conductor grouping for connectivity
determination.  This may be fine for some applications, and avoids
computation.  In MOS circuits, for example, if the Active layer is
assumed to be a conductor, then all FETs will be shorted, drain to
source.  However, using a {\et Conductor Exclude} directive for Poly
on Active should fix this.

\item{\vt -l}\\
If this is given, when the flat data are read into memory for
processing, any existing layer filtering is kept.  Without this
option, when {\vt -ne} is not given, all layers are read since these
may affect device recognition.  When {\vt -ne} is given, only
{\et Conductor} and {\et Via} layers are read.

\item{\vt -k}\\
If given, all working files are retained.  Without this option, edge
files, etc.  are deleted when no longer needed.

\item{\vt -s1}\\
If given, the operation will stop at the end of Stage 1.

\item{\vt -s2}\\
If given, the operation will stop at the end of Stage 2.
\end{description}

The grid cells are assigned x,y index numbers, according to position,
with the 0,0 cell located in the lower left corner.  The cells are
traversed left to right by row, from bottom to top.  Each net in a
grid is assigned a number, which is the group number from extraction. 
All three numbers are non-negative, and the triplets represent a
unique designation for a subnet.  The net cells in the Stage 1 OASIS
files files are names ``{\it x\_y\_n\/}'', i.e., the three numbers
separated by underscores.

In the final OASIS file, the net cells are renamed {\vt n1}, {\vt n2},
..., replacing the triples with an index number.  If instantiation is
used, the subnet cells that are not primary nets retain the original
names.  The primary subnet from among a group of connected subnets is
the one that is lowest in ``traversal order'', which is the lowest
group number in the first grid cell seen in a sweep left to right in
the rows, ascending in y.

    <p>
    This command manipulates instance arrays.  There are three forms:

    <p>
    <b><tt>!array -u</tt></b><br>
    This will "unarray" all selected arrays.  The arrays are converted
    to individual instance placements, in the same location and
    orientation as the original array elements.

    <p>
    <b><tt>!array -d</tt>
      [<i>nx1</i>[-<i>nx2</i>] , [<i>ny1</i>[-<i>ny2</i>]]</b><br>
    This form will delete a rectangular region of array elements.  The
    undeleted elements will be configured into a new collection of arrays
    or single instance placements.

    <p>
    The command operates on a selected instance array, the most
    recently selected if there is more than one.

    <p>
    If no arguments follow the option character, the user is asked to
    click on or drag over the array, to define two points.  The two
    points are transformed back into the coordinate system of the
    instance master, and define a rectangular region in the array
    indices in that space.  The elements corresponding to this
    rectangle are deleted, and new arrays or separate instances are
    created to replace the undeleted elements.

    <p>
    Otherwise, the range of x and y indices to delete is given on the
    command line.  These indices are non-negative 0-based, and the x
    and y ranges are separated by a comma.  A range can be a single
    number, or two numbers separated by '-'.  If a single number, the
    range is taken as that number only.

    <p>
    In the untransformed array, the 0,0 location is the lower-left
    corner.

    <p>
    <b>Example</b>:<br>
    Suppose that a 3x3 array is selected.<br>
    Erase the middle element: <tt>!array -d 1,1</tt><br>

     [<tt>ny</tt> [+]= <i>val</i>] [<tt>dx</tt> [+]= <i>val</i>]
     [<tt>dy</tt> [+]= <i>val</i>]</b><br>
    This will reconfigure the array parameters of the first selected
    instance.  It can convert instances into arrays and vice-versa.

    <p>
    All of the parameter groups are optional, but at least one group
    should be given or the operation does nothing.  Each is in the
    form <i>keyword</i> [+]= <i>value</i>.  It a '+' appears ahead of

    values must be one or larger.  The <tt>dx</tt> and <tt>dy</tt> are
    the array cell spacing in the untransformed x and y directions,

    This command produces new geometry on a new or existing layer, by

    <p>
    This new geometry can appear as an assemblage of trapezoids if
    either of the <tt>split</tt> or <tt>splitv</tt> keywords is given,
    or alternatively as a minimal number of complex polygons if the
    <tt>join</tt> keyword is given instead.  If <tt>splitv</tt> is
    given, a vertical orientation is favored for the decomposition,
    whereas similarly <tt>split</tt> will produce a decomposition
    favoring a horizontal orientation.  The default is the joined form
    if none of these optional keywords is given, except when simply
    copying from another layer in which case the default is to copy
    objects without change.  The keyword "<tt>splith</tt>" is a
    synonym for "<tt>split</tt>".  The options <tt>-j</tt>,
    <tt>-s</tt> or <tt>-sh</tt>, and <tt>-sv</tt> are equivalent to

    <p>
    The <b>!layer</b> command, when using boolean operations, uses
    gridding to improve efficiency for large data sets.  Internally, a
    square grid with origin at the lower-left corner of the cell
    bounding box is logically defined.  The calculations are performed
    for each grid square that overlaps the cell area, and the results
    are combined.  This can be more efficient that calculating the
    whole cell in one shot.

    <p>
    The default grid size is 100 microns square, which can be changed
    with the <a href="PartitionSize"><b>PartitionSize</b></a>
    variable.  This can be set to an alternate grid size in microns,
    as a floating-point number.  The cell lower left corner is on the
    grid boundary.  The operations are performed piecewise in each
    grid area that intersects the cell.

    <p>
    If this variable is set to "0", no grid is used, and operations
    will be performed over the entire cell at once.

    <p>
    The <b>PartitionSize</b> variable can be set with a control in the
    <b>Evaluate Layer Expression</b> panel from the <b>Layer
    Expression</b> button in the <b>Edit Menu</b>, or with the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command.

    <p>
    When joining objects, there are several variables which fine-tune
    the operation.  See the description of the <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> command for information.

    <p>
    If <i>layer_name</i> does not exist in the layer table, it will be

    generated from the given name in the same way as in the <a
    href="techfile:layers">technology file</a> layer definitions.

    <p>
    The <i>expression</i>, if given, involves layer names and
    operators as in the DRC <a href="layer_exp">layer expressions</a>. 
    The result of the expression is created on <i>layer_name</i>. 
    Thus, this command provides a means of creating a new layer from
    geometry on existing layers.  It operates on the physical part of
    the current cell.  Labels are ignored.  The same <i>layer_name</i>
    can exist on both sides of the expression, in which case the
    contents of the <i>layer_name</i> is replaced with the result of
    <i>expression</i>.  The equal sign between <i>layer_name</i> and
    <i>expression</i> is optional.

    <p>
    If no <i>expression</i> is given, the new layer will be created if
    necessary, which will be the only effect if done.  If the
    <i>layer_name</i> already exists, and one of the <tt>split</tt>,
    <tt>splitv</tt>, or <tt>join</tt> keywords is given, the operation
    will be applied to that layer, much like the <a
    href="!split"><b>!split</b></a> and <a
    href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> commands.

    <p>
    If the <i>expression</i> consists of a layer name only, the
    objects on that layer will be copied to <i>layer_name</i>, and
    split/joined if the keywords are given.  When simply copying
    and/or joining/splitting, no grid partitioning is used.

    <p>
    Copying and splitting/joining are available in electrical mode. 
    Other operations require running the <b>!layer</b> command in
    physical mode, and apply to physical data.

    <p>
    There are several option flags which can be given.  These must
    appear before <i>layer_name</i> in the command line.  The options
    can be given separately as shown in the syntax example above, or
    grouped, e.g., "<tt>-dmf</tt> <i>depth</i>" is equivalent to
    "<tt>-d</tt> <i>depth</i> <tt>-m</tt> <tt>-f</tt>".  Any
    combination of grouped or single flags can be used.  If a group
    contains '<tt>d</tt>', the token that follows must be the
    <i>depth</i>.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-j</tt><dd>
    Equivalent to giving the <tt>join</tt> keyword.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-s</tt> or <tt>-sh</tt><dd>
    Equivalent to giving the <tt>split</tt> keyword.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-sv</tt><dd>
    Equivalent to giving the <tt>splitv</tt> keyword.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-d</tt> <i>depth</i>, <tt>-da</tt><dd>
    The <i>depth</i> is a non-negative integer indicating the depth
    into the cell hierarchy to process.  It can also be a word
    starting with the letter '<tt>a</tt>' to indicate all levels.  If
    0 (the default) only objects in the current cell are processed. 
    If "<tt>all</tt>", all objects in the hierarchy may be used to
    generate the new objects, effectively flattening.  The <tt>-da</tt>
    form is equivalent to "<tt>-d all</tt>".
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-r</tt><dd>
    This applies when the <i>depth</i> is larger than 0.  When given,
    the <b>expression</b> is evaluated in all cells in the hierarchy
    to <i>depth</i>, using only objects in that cell and creating
    objects in that cell.  This is very different from the behavior
    without this flag given, which is to create all objects in the
    current cell.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-c</tt><dd>
    By default, <i>layer_name</i> is cleared before the
    <i>expression</i> is evaluated, so that the layer contains only
    the result of the operation on command completion.  If this flag
    is given, the layer will not be cleared, so that the original
    objects will be retained on the layer.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-m</tt><dd>
    When this flag is set, objects added to <i>layer_name</i> will be
    merged with existing objects, using the same merging as
    established with the <b>Merge new boxes and polys with existing
    boxes/polys</b> and <b>Clip and merge new boxes only, not
    polys</b> check boxes in the <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing
    Setup</b></a> panel from the <b>Edit Menu</b>, or the
    corresponding variables.  Use of full polygon merging can greatly
    increase processing time, simple box clipping/merging has much
    lower overhead.  Merging may reduce the object count in the
    layout.

    <p>
    The merging will defeat the purpose of the split keywords, so the
    user should consider whether merging is appropriate.  Merging
    includes the initial objects on the <i>layer_name</i> if it is not
    cleared, and the accumulated objects as evaluation takes place.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>-f</tt><dd>
    This flag indicates "fast" mode, where undo list generation and any
    merging (other than a join operation) are skipped.  This operation
    is not undoable, so this option should be used with care.  It
    speeds processing and reduces memory use.

    <h2>Extended Layer Names</h2>
    
    <p>
    The layer names in layer expressions in the <b>!layer</b> command
    can acutally be given in an extended form:

    <blockquote>
    <i>lname</i>[<tt>.</tt><i>stname</i>][<tt>.</tt><i>cellname</i>]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Most generally, the "layer" name consists of three tokens, two of
    which are optional (indicated by square brackets above).  The
    tokens are separated by a period ('<tt>.</tt>') character.  The
    individual tokens can be double-quoted (i.e., using the
    double-quote ('<tt>"</tt>') character), which must be used if the
    tokens contain non-alphanumeric characters.  The period
    separators must appear outside the scope of any quoting.

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><i>lname</i><dd>
    This is a short or long layer name, as found in the layer table.
    <dt><i>stname</i><dd>
    The name of a <a href="xic:stabs">symbol table</a> which contains
    the <i>cellname</i>.
    <dt><i>cellname</i><dd>
    The name of a cell.
    </dl>

    <p>
    If only one separator appears, the token that follows is taken as the
    <i>cellname</i>, and the current symbol table is assumed.

    <p>
    The <i>cellname</i> is the name of a cell used as the source for
    geometry.  If no <i>cellname</i> is given, the name of the
    current cell is understood.  The odd case of an empty
    <i>stname</i> indicates the "<tt>main</tt>" symbol table, e.g.,
    <tt>layer..cell</tt> is equivalent to <tt>layer.main.cell</tt>.

    <p>
    If the <i>cellname</i> starts with the '<tt>@</tt>' character, and
    no symbol table name is given, then the rest of the
    <i>cellname</i> is taken as the name of a "special" database, as
    created with script functions like <a
    href="ChdOpenZdb"><tt>ChdOpenZdb</tt></a>.  If found, geometry
    will be obtained from the database rather than a cell.  Otherwise,
    when a <i>cellname</i> is given, the geometry is obtained from the
    given cell, as if it were overlaid on the current cell.  The
    <i>cellname</i> (or any of the three tokens) can be double quoted,
    and must be quoted if the name contains a '<tt>.</tt>' character,
    for example <tt>CPG."mycell.xic"</tt>.

    <p>
    If a <i>stname</i> is given, and the name matches an existing
    symbol table name, the cell is obtained from that symbol table. 
    If the symbol table name is given, the <i>cellname</i> field must
    appear, but can be empty (a trailing period) which indicates the
    name of the current cell.

    <p>
    If the <i>stname</i> is given, and the cell is not in this table,
    it will be opened from disk into the given table (not the current
    table) if found as a native cell file in the search path.

    <p>
    The coordinate origin of the source cell is taken as the origin of
    the current cell.  The source cell must be in memory, or be in a
    native cell in the search path.

    <p>
    Objects read from a "special" database are clipped to the boundary
    of the cell being added to.  No such clipping is done when objects
    are read from another cell.

    <h2>Advanced Examples</h2>

    <p>
    Suppose one has two versions of a cell, <tt>cell</tt> and
    <tt>cell_old</tt>, and one needs to know if they differ on layer
    <tt>M1</tt>.  Open a dummy cell for editing, then issue
    <blockquote>
      <tt>!layer ZZ = M1.cell^M1.cell_old</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Press the <b>Home</b> key to view the entire cell space.  Any
    geometry shown on the new dummy layer <tt>ZZ</tt> is the
    exclusive-OR of the geometry on <tt>M1</tt> of the two cells,
    i.e., the difference.  If there is no geometry on <tt>ZZ</tt>,
    <tt>M1</tt> is the same in <tt>cell</tt> and <tt>cell_old</tt>.

    <p>
    As a variation, suppose that the user has done the following:
    <blockquote><tt>
      <i>set <a href="xic:stabs">symbol table</a> to</i> "<tt>old</tt>"<br>
      open oldstuff/mycell<br>
      <i>return to previous symbol table</i><br>
      open newstuff/mycell
    </tt></blockquote>
    There are two versions of <tt>mycell</tt> in memory.  To compare
    the layer <tt>M1</tt> in the two cells, one could then enter
    <blockquote>
      <tt>!layer ZZ M1^M1.old.</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Then the <tt>ZZ</tt> layer, which consists of the exclusive-OR of
    old and new <tt>M1</tt> in <tt>mycell</tt>, would be added to the
    current <tt>mycell</tt>.  Pressing the <b>Tab</b> key undoes the
    addition.

    <p>
    Suppose one wants to import the inverse of the geometry on layer
    <tt>VIA</tt> from <tt>cell</tt> into the current cell, also on
    layer <tt>VIA</tt>:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>!layer VIA = !VIA.cell</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The <tt>VIA</tt> layer now consists of the inverse from
    <tt>cell</tt>.  Any geometry that existed on <tt>VIA</tt> in the
    current cell before the command was given is deleted.  The
    bounding box of the current cell may have been expanded to include
    the bounding box of <tt>cell</tt>.  The area used to create an
    inversion is the rectangle bounding all cells referenced in the
    expression, plus the current cell.

    <p>
    Suppose one simply wants to copy the geometry from layer M2 of

    </blockquote>
    The <tt>M2</tt> layer now consists of the geometry on <tt>M2</tt>

    been expanded, in which case some of the <tt>M2</tt> features may
    be off-screen (press the <b>Home</b> key to view the entire cell). 
    Any objects previously existing on <tt>M2</tt> in the current cell

\begin{quote}
Syntax: {\vt !layer [join|split|splitv] [-j | -s[h] | -sv]
 [-d {\it depth\/} | -da] [-r] [-c]
 [-m] [-f] {\it layer\_name} [=] [{\it expression\/}]}
\end{quote}
This command produces new geometry on a new or existing layer, by
applying a layer expression which takes as input geometry from the
same or other layers, from the current cell or from other cells in
memory.  The {\cb Layer Expression} button in the {\cb Edit Menu}
provides a panel which duplicates the functionality of this command.

This new geometry can appear as an assemblage of trapezoids if either
of the {\vt split} or {\vt splitv} keywords is given, or alternatively
as a minimal number of complex polygons if the {\vt join} keyword is
given instead.  If {\vt splitv} is given, a vertical orientation is
favored for the decomposition, whereas similarly {\vt split} will
produce a decomposition favoring a horizontal orientation.  The
default is the joined form if none of these optional keywords is
given, except when simply copying from another layer in which case the
default is to copy objects without change.  The keyword ``{\vt
splith}'' is a synonym for ``{\vt split}''.  The options {\vt -j},
{\vt -s} or {\vt -sh}, and {\vt -sv} are equivalent to giving the {\vt
join}, {\vt split}, and {\vt splitv} keywords.

The {\cb !layer} command, when using boolean operations, uses gridding
to improve efficiency for large data sets.  Internally, a square grid
with origin at the lower-left corner of the cell bounding box is
logically defined.  The calculations are performed for each grid
square that overlaps the cell area, and the results are combined. 
This can be more efficient that calculating the whole cell in one
shot.
 
The default grid size is 100 microns square, which can be changed
with the {\et PartitionSize} variable.  This can be set to an
alternate grid size in microns, as a floating-point number.  The cell
lower left corner is on the grid boundary.  The operations are
performed piecewise in each grid area that intersects the cell.

If this variable is set to ``0'', no grid is used, and operations 
will be performed over the entire cell at once.

The {\et PartitionSize} variable can be set with a control in the {\cb
Evaluate Layer Expression} panel from the {\cb Layer Expression}
button in the {\cb Edit Menu}, or with the {\cb !set} command.

When joining objects, there are several variables which fine-tune the
operation.  See the description of the {\cb !join} command
(\ref{joincmd}) for information.

If {\it layer\_name} does not exist in the layer table, it will be
created.  Otherwise, the {\it layer\_name} is the short or long name
of an existing layer.  If a new layer is created, its name is
generated from the given name in the same way as in the technology
file layer definitions.

The {\it expression}, if given, involves layer names and operators as
in the DRC layer expressions (see \ref{layerexp}).  The result of the
expression is created on {\it layer\_name}.  Thus, this command
provides a means of creating a new layer from geometry on existing
layers.  It operates on the physical part of the current cell.  Labels
are ignored.  The same {\it layer\_name} can exist on both sides of
the expression, in which case the contents of the {\it layer\_name} is
replaced with the result of {\it expression}.  The equal sign between
{\it layer\_name} and {\it expression} is optional.

If no {\it expression} is given, the new layer will be created if
necessary, which will be the only effect if done.  If the {\it
layer\_name} already exists, and one of the {\vt split}, {\vt splitv},
or {\vt join} keywords is given, the operation will be applied to that
layer, much like the {\cb !split} and {\cb !join} commands.

If the {\it expression} consists of a layer name only, the objects on
that layer will be copied to {\it layer\_name}, and split/joined if
the keywords are given.  When simply copying and/or joining/splitting,
no grid partitioning is used.

Copying and splitting/joining are available in electrical mode.  Other
operations require running the {\cb !layer} command in physical mode,
and apply to physical data.

There are several option flags which can be given.  These must appear
before {\it layer\_name} in the command line.  The options can be
given separately as shown in the syntax example above, or grouped,
e.g., ``{\vt -dmf} {\it depth\/}'' is equivalent to ``{\vt -d} {\it
depth} {\vt -m} {\vt -f}''.  Any combination of grouped or single
flags can be used.  If a group contains `{\vt d}', the token that
follows must be the {\it depth}.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt -j}\\
Equivalent to giving the {\vt join} keyword.

\item{\vt -s} or {\vt -sh}\\
Equivalent to giving the {\vt split} keyword.

\item{\vt -sv}\\
Equivalent to giving the {\vt splitv} keyword.

\item{\vt -d} {\it depth}, {\vt -da}\\
The {\it depth} is a non-negative integer indicating the depth into
the cell hierarchy to process.  It can also be a word starting with
the letter `{\vt a}' to indicate all levels.  If 0 (the default) only
objects in the current cell are processed.  If ``{\vt all}'', all
objects in the hierarchy may be used to generate the new objects,
effectively flattening.  The {\vt -da} variation is equivalent to
``{\vt -d all}''.

\item{\vt -r}\\
This applies when the {\it depth} is larger than 0.  When given, the
{\it expression} is evaluated in all cells in the hierarchy to {\it
depth\/}, using only objects in that cell and creating objects in that
cell.  This is very different from the behavior without this flag
given, which is to create all objects in the current cell.

\item{\vt -c}\\
By default, {\it layer\_name} is cleared before the {\it expression}
is evaluated, so that the layer contains only the result of the
operation on command completion.  If this flag is given, the layer
will not be cleared, so that the original objects will be retained on
the layer.

\item{\vt -m}\\
When this flag is set, objects added to {\it layer\_name} will be
merged with existing objects, using the same merging as established
with the {\cb Merge new boxes and polys with existing boxes/polys} and
{\cb Clip and merge new boxes only, not polys} check boxes in the {\cb
Editing Setup} panel from the {\cb Edit Menu}, or the corresponding
variables.  Use of full polygon merging can greatly increase
processing time, simple box clipping/merging has much lower overhead. 
Merging may reduce the object count in the layout.

The merging will defeat the purpose of the split keywords, so the user
should consider whether merging is appropriate.  Merging includes the
initial objects on the {\it layer\_name} if it is not cleared, and the
accumulated objects as evaluation takes place.

\item{\vt -f}\\
This flag indicates ``fast'' mode, where undo list generation and any
merging (other than a join operation) are skipped.  This operation is
not undoable, so this option should be used with care.  It speeds
processing and reduces memory use.

The user will be prompted to confirm before the operation is actually
initiated.

{\vt !layer NEW I1\&I2}
\item{Copy the R1 and R2 areas to NEW:}\\
{\vt !layer NEW R1|R2}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Extended Layer Names}
The layer names in layer expressions in the {\cb !layer} command can
actually be given in an extended form:

\begin{quote}
{\it lname\/}[{\vt .}{\it stname\/}][{\vt .}{\it cellname\/}]
\end{quote}

Most generally, the ``layer'' name consists of three tokens, two of
which are optional (indicated by square brackets above).  The tokens
are separated by a period (`{\vt .}') character.  The individual
tokens can be double-quoted (i.e., using the double-quote (`{\vt "}')
character), which must be used if the tokens contain non-alphanumeric
characters.  The period separators must appear outside the scope of
any quoting.

\begin{description}
\item{\it lname}\\
This is a short or long layer name, as found in the layer table.
\item{\it stname}\\
The name of a symbol table which contains the {\it cellname}.
\item{\it cellname}\\
The name of a cell.
\end{description}

If only one separator appears, the token that follows is taken as the
{\it cellname}, and the current symbol table (see \ref{symtab}) is
assumed.

The {\it cellname} is the name of a cell used as the source for
geometry.  If no {\it cellname} is given, the name of the current cell
is understood.  The odd case of an empty {\it stname} indicates the
``{\vt main}'' symbol table, e.g., {\vt layer..cell} is equivalent to
{\vt layer.main.cell}.

If the {\it cellname} starts with the '{\vt \@}' character, and no
symbol table name is given, then the rest of the {\it cellname} is
taken as the name of a ``special'' database, as created with script
functions like {\vt ChdOpenZdb}.  If found, geometry will be obtained
from the database rather than a cell.  Otherwise, when a {\it
cellname} is given, the geometry is obtained from the given cell, as
if it were overlaid on the current cell.  The {\it cellname} (or any
of the three tokens) can be double quoted, and must be quoted if the
name contains a `{\vt .}' character, for example {\vt
CPG."mycell.xic"}.

If a {\it stname} is given, and the name matches an existing symbol
table name, the cell is obtained from that symbol table.  If the
symbol table name is given, the {\it cellname} field must appear, but
can be empty (a trailing period) which indicates the name of the
current cell.

If the {\it stname} is given, and the cell is not in this table, it
will be opened from disk into the given table (not the current table)
if found as a native cell file in the search path.

The coordinate origin of the source cell is taken as the origin of the
current cell.  The source cell must be in memory, or be in a native
cell in the search path.

Objects read from a ``special'' database are clipped to the boundary
of the cell being added to.  No such clipping is done when objects are
read from another cell.

\subsubsection{Advanced Examples}

Suppose one has two versions of a cell, {\vt cell} and {\vt
cell\_old}, and one needs to know if they differ on layer {\vt M1}. 
Open a dummy cell for editing, then issue
\begin{quote}\vt
!layer ZZ = M1.cell\symbol{94}M1.cell\_old
\end{quote}
Press the {\kb Home} key to view the entire cell space.  Any geometry
shown on the new dummy layer {\vt ZZ} is the exclusive-OR of the
geometry on {\vt M1} of the two cells, i.e., the difference.  If there
is no geometry on {\vt ZZ}, {\vt M1} is the same in {\vt cell} and
{\vt cell\_old}.

As a variation, suppose that the user has done the following:
\begin{quote}\vt
  {\it Set symbol table to} ``{\vt old}''.\\
  open oldstuff/mycell\\
  {\it Return to previous symbol table.}\\
  open newstuff/mycell
\end{quote}
There are two versions of {\vt mycell} in memory.  To compare the
layer {\vt M1} in the two cells, one could then enter
\begin{quote}\vt
  !layer ZZ M1\symbol{94}M1.old.
\end{quote}
Then the {\vt ZZ} layer, which consists of the exclusive-OR of old and
new {\vt M1} in {\vt mycell}, would be added to the current {\vt
mycell}.  Pressing the {\kb Tab} key undoes the addition.

Suppose one wants to import the inverse of the geometry on layer {\vt
VIA} from {\vt cell} into the current cell, also on layer {\vt VIA}:
\begin{quote}\vt
  !layer VIA = !VIA.cell
\end{quote}
The {\vt VIA} layer now consists of the inverse from {\vt cell}.  Any
geometry that existed on {\vt VIA} in the current cell before the
command was given is deleted.  The bounding box of the current cell
may have been expanded to include the bounding box of {\vt cell}.  The
area used to create an inversion is the rectangle bounding all cells
referenced in the expression, plus the current cell.

Suppose one simply wants to copy the geometry from layer {\vt M2} of
{\vt cell} into the current cell:
\begin{quote}\vt
      !layer M2 = M2.cell
\end{quote}
The {\vt M2} layer now consists of the geometry on {\vt M2} from {\vt
cell}.  The bounding box of the current cell may have been expanded,
in which case some of the {\vt M2} features may be off-screen (press
the {\kb Home} key to view the entire cell).  Any objects previously
existing on {\vt M2} in the current cell are deleted before the
operation.

offset by {\it x}, {\it y} (in microns) from the original object.  If
not given, {\it y} is zero.

The third argument, if given, will allow a layer change during the
move.  It should be the name of a layer that is not the current layer. 
How this is applied depends on the setting of the {\et
LayerChangeMode} variable, or equivalently the settings of the {\cb
Layer Change Mode} pop-up from the {\cb Set Layer Chg Mode} button
in the {\cb Modify Menu}.  For the layer change, the passed {\it

current layer does not change.  Subcells are moved without regard to
{\it layer\_name} or the layer change mode.

There is a companion {\cb !co} (copy) command.

    The <i>dimen</i> is a dimension in microns.  The command will
    operate on selected objects, and alter the dimensions according to
    the <i>dimen</i> given.  If the <i>dimen</i> is positive, the
    parts of edges that do not contact or overlap with a selected
    object on the same layer will be pushed out by <i>dimen</i>,
    expanding the objects.  If <i>dimen</i> is negative, the reverse
    occurs:  objects will shrink, but adjacent objects will remain
    touching.  Objects may be severed into two or more pieces if the
    <i>dimen</i> is negative, or may disappear entirely.

    <p>
    Only <a href="xic:box">boxes</a>, <a href="xic:wire">wires</a> and
    <a href="xic:polyg">polygons</a> are affected.  Wires and possibly
    boxes become polygons after the operation.  An object is
    deselected if it is modified.

    <p>
    There are a number of operational details and choices available
    with the <i>mode</i> integer, whose bits represent flags.  This
    value can be given as a decimal integer, or as a hexadecimal
    number following "<tt>0x</tt>".  If the <i>mode</i> argument is
    missing, a value of 0 is implied.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bits 0-1</b> (0x1, 0x2)<dd>

    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 2</b> (0x4)<dd>
      When set, the algorithm mode calls the "old" bloating
      algorithms, as used in releases prior to 2.5.67.  If this bit is
      set, all of the other flag bits are ignored.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 3</b> (0x8)<dd>
     When set, the return is the edge template, and no bloating is
     done.  The edge template is a collection of polygons that cover
     the edges of objects that would be bloated, as a path, whose
     width is twice the <i>dimen</i>.  When bloating, the edge
     template is either added to the objects being bloated, or clipped
     from them, depending on the sign of <i>dimen</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bits 4-6</b> (0x70)<dd>
    These three bits specify the corner "fill-in" mode, used when
    constructing the edge template.  Consider a vertex and two
    adjacent edges.  Imagine the rectangles formed from these edges by
    constructing parallel edges plus and minus <i>dimen</i>
    perpendicular to the edges, and using the four endpoints of the
    parallel segments to define two rectangles.  The two rectangles
    will overlap, with a notch at the original vertex location. 
    Adding a suitable shape to fill in this notch, thus creating a
    smooth transition, is the purpose of the corner fill-in.

    <p>
    The corner fill-in shape has three points initially defined, the
    vertex, and the two projections along the ends of the constructed
    rectangles.  The differences between the fill-in modes is where (or if)
    we add the fourth point to the fill-in polygon.  The choices are
    as follows:
        <dl>
        <dt>bits 4-6: 000 ("clip" mode)<dd>
        The angle is bisected, and the point added is a distance given
        by the absolute value of <i>dimen</i> from the vertex, along
        the bisector.  This produces a rounding effect at the corner.

        <dt>bits 4-6: 001 ("flat" mode)<dd>
        No fourth point is added, only a triangle formed by the existing
        three points is used.

        <dt>bits 4-6: 010 ("extend" mode)<dd>
        The point added is the projected intersection of the outer
        edges of the two rectangles.  For acute angles, the distance
        to the extended vertex is unconstrained. 

        <dt>bits 4-6: 011 ("extend-1" mode)<dd>
        The point added is the projected intersection of the outer
        edges of the two rectangles.  For acute angles, if the corner
        would extend too far, is is clipped (similar to the "clip"
        mode).

        <dt>bits 4-6: 100 ("extend-2" mode)<dd>
        This mode is similar to the "extend-1" mode, but provides a
        different and more aggressive clipping of acute angles.

        <dt>bits 4-6: 101 (unused)<dd>
        This code is reserved for expansion, produces no corner fill.

        <dt>bits 4-6: 110 (unused)<dd>
        This code is reserved for expansion, produces no corner fill.

        <dt>bits 4-6: 111 (no fill)<dd>
        This produces no corner fill.
        </dl>

        <p>
        Small angles will use the "flat" corner fill mode to avoid
        adding unnecessary vertices, in all modes.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 7</b> (0x80)<dd>
    When using the "extend" corner modes, it is possible in certain
    geometries that the extended corner will occur on the opposite
    side of an edge rectangle from some other edge, which will produce
    unexpected features in the bloating result.  In order to prevent
    this, a rather expensive test is performed.  Setting this bit will
    skip the test, speeding up the operation somewhat.  In Manhattan
    geometry, this test can always be skipped.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 8</b> (0x100)<dd>
    Internally, the grouping operation that is part of the preparation
    for the edge template generation is skipped.  This is an internal
    artifact, and this flag should not be set.  However, if only a
    single object is being bloated, this flag may provide a slight
    speed improvement.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 9</b> (0x200)<dd>
    Internally, clipping/merging of the trapezoid list passed to the
    bloating function is skipped.  This is an internal artifact and
    this flag should not be set.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 10</b> (0x400)<dd>
    When this bit is set, a scaling algorithm is applied during the
    bloating, which very slightly (+/- one internal unit) affects
    output coordinates.  This is the result of a very specialized
    customer request that output exactly match that from another tool,
    and is not likely to be generally useful.

    <p>
    The scale fix will provide more accurate bloating when all angles
    are multiples of 45 degrees.  It is not needed for Manhattan
    geometry, and for angles other than 45 degree multiples, it can
    actually reduce accuracy.  For best accuracy in the all-angle
    case, the <a
    href="DatabaseResolution"><b>DatabaseResolution</b></a> variable
    can be set to a larger value.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 11</b> (0x800)<dd>
    When this bit is set, the trapezoid collection used to define the
    edge template will not be clipped and merged before use.  This is
    an internal artifact and this flag should not be set.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bit 12</b> (0x1000)<dd>
    When this bit is set, the resulting trapezoid collection produced
    for the edge template or by the bloating operation will not be
    joined into polygons.
    </dl>
 
    <p>
    The basic algorithm for modes 0-2 works as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>The collection of objects to bloat is converted to a trapezoid
    representation.
    <li>The resulting trapezoid list is grouped into multiple lists of
    spatially disjoint lists, where each list is mutually connected
    and no trapezoid touches or overlaps a trapezoid from another list.
    <li>For each list, the line segments representing the trapezoid edges
    are tabulated.
    <li>The edge list is clipped against itself to remove mutually
    overlapping regions.  The remaining edges are the "external"
    edges, where one side is area outside of the trapezoid group.
    <li>Each edge is converted to a rectangle that covers the edge and
    extends +/- the bloat width normal from the edge (note that these
    rectangles are rotated by an arbitrary angle, depending on the
    angle of the line segment).
    <li>The rectangles are converted to trapezoids.  The non-Manhattan
    rotated rectangles are represented by three trapezoids.
    <li>A polygon, implemented as trapezoids, is added at each vertex,
    to fill in the transition between edge segments.  The list of all
    these trapezoids represents a path along the external edges of the
    original trapezoid group.
    <li>If the bloat value is positive, the edge list is or'ed with
    the original trapezoid list.  If the bloat value is negative, the
    edge list is clipped from the original trapezoid group.  If bit 3
    is set, this step is skipped, and the edge list is passed to the
    next step.
    <li>The resulting trapezoid list is merged into polygons,
    representing the operation result.
    </ol>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bloat mode 0</b><dd>
    If a trapezoid group is entirely Manhattan, meaning that all edges
    are horizontal or vertical, no corner vertex fill-in takes place. 
    Instead, the vertical line segments are extended by the (positive)
    bloat dimension.  Thus, bloated Manhattan objects always remain
    Manhattan.

    <p>
    Otherwise, the polygon to fill the empty area at a vertex between
    the segment rectangles is computed, according to the corner
    fill-in mode.  This may add vertices to the resulting figures,
    giving rounded corners.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bloat mode 1</b><dd>
    This mode is faster, but is not recommended for non-Manhattan
    geometry.  The vertical segment ends are extended by the bloat
    dimension to cover (assumed) Manhattan corners.  Non-Manhattan
    segments are added as a single trapezoid with a width computed
    from the bloat dimension.  Note that this can cause small
    protrusions and other anomalies to appear after bloating.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bloat mode 2</b><dd>
    This is the same as bloat mode 0, however the corners of Manhattan
    and non-Manhattan objects will be treated the same.  The corners
    of positive-bloated boxes may be rounded, unlike mode 0.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>bloat mode 3</b><dd>
    This mode uses the DRC sizing functions to perform the bloating
    operation, with results similar to mode 2.  All of the other flags
    except for bit 3 (edge template) are ignored with this choice.  If
    bit 3 is set, an edge template is created, extending out of the
    original figure if the bloat value is positive, or inward if the
    bloat value is negative.

    <p>
    This mode works best if a <a href="!join"><b>!join</b></a> is
    performed before the bloat.  This algorithm is rather compute
    intensive and slower than the other algorithms.  In this
    algorithm, parts of edges that touch an object on the same layer
    will not be moved, whether or not the adjacent object was
    selected.  In the other algorithms, unselected objects are
    completely ignored.

    In the description, we assume that the object is being expanded,
    i.e., the <i>dimen</i> is greater than zero.  For each edge, an
    extension out of the object normal to the edge is created.  For
    each corner where the edge projections do not overlap, a 4-sided
    polygon is created.  Three of the vertices are the figure corner
    vertex and the ends of the two adjacent projections.  The fourth
    vertex is placed along the bisector of the angle formed by the
    other three vertices, a distance <i>dimen</i> from the object
    corner vertex.  All of the projections are joined to the original
    object to create the expanded object.  Note that the corners
    become rounded, i.e., bloated rectangles become polygons.  The
    figure below illustrates the algorithm.

    If the <i>dimen</i> is less than zero, the object will be shrunk.

    This algorithm works with a trapezoid decomposition of the objects
    to be modified.  An expansion is very fast, but a shrink requires
    polarity inversion of the trapezoid list, so is somewhat slower. 
    This algorithm is not really recommended for non-Manhattan
    geometry, since in working at the trapezoid level without
    considering adjacency, small artifacts are often introduced at
    non-Manhattan corners.

    <p>
    The algorithm takes the following steps:

    <p>
    If <i>dimen</i> > 0 (expanding)<br>
    <ol>
    <li>Decompose all selected objects on a given layer into a

    <li>Create a second list containing trapezoids derived from the
      edges of trapezoids in the first list, created to enclose each
      edge and the surrounding area to +/- <i>dimen</i> normal to the

    <li>Merge the two lists and join into polygons.
    </ol>

    <p>
    If <i>dimen</i> &#60; 0 (shrinking)
    <ol>
    <li>Decompose all selected objects on a given layer into a

    <li>Invert the list in a rectangle that encloses all trapezoids
      bloated by <i>dimen<i>.
    <li>Create an edge trapezoid list from the inverted list.
    <li>Clip out the regions of the original list that overlap trapezoids
      in the edge list.
    <li>Merge the resulting list into polygons.
    </ol>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>old mode 2</b><dd>
    In this algorithm, for <i>dimen</i> larger than zero, the objects
    are first joined into maximal polygons, i.e., no two of these
    polygons abut or overlap.  The vertex list of each polygon is used
    to construct a "wire" of width 2*<i>dimen</i>, which is then
    converted to a polygon representation.  The wire polygon covers
    the edge of the original polygon, extending by <i>dimen</i> inside
    and outside of the figure.  Each polygon becomes the union of the
    original polygon and its "wire" polygon.  If <i>dimen</i> is less
    than zero, the geometry is inverted first as in the previous
    algorithm.  Thus, the edge "wires" around the clear areas are
    found.  These are clipped from the dark areas, yielding the final
    figures.  Without the inversion, polygons with holes would not be
    processed correctly.

    <p>
    Note that bloating modes 1 and 2 will not round the corners, i.e.,
    Manhattan corners remain Manhattan.

\begin{quote}
Syntax: {\vt !bloat} {\it dimen} [{\it mode\/}]
\end{quote}
The {\it dimen} is a dimension in microns.  The command will operate
on selected objects, and alter the dimensions according to the {\it
dimen} given.  If the {\it dimen} is positive, the parts of edges that
do not contact or overlap with a selected object on the same layer
will be pushed out by {\it dimen}, expanding the objects.  If {\it
dimen} is negative, the reverse occurs:  objects will shrink, but
adjacent objects will remain touching.  Objects may be severed into
two or more pieces if the {\it dimen} is negative, or may disappear
entirely.

Only boxes, wires and polygons are affected.  Wires and and possibly
boxes become polygons after the operation.  An object is deselected if
it is modified.

There are a number of operational details and choices available with
the {\it mode} integer, whose bits represent flags.  This value can be
given as a decimal integer, or as a hexadecimal number following ``{\vt
0x}''.  If the {\it mode} argument is missing, a value of 0 is implied.

\begin{description}
\item{\bf bits 0-1} (0x1, 0x2)\\
The two LSBs specify the basic algorithm mode, as described below.

\item{\bf bit 2} (0x4)\\
When set, the algorithm mode calls the ``old'' bloating algorithms, as
used in releases prior to 2.5.67.  If this bit is set, all of the
other flag bits are ignored.

\item{\bf bit 3} (0x8)\\
When set, the return is the edge template, and no bloating is done. 
The edge template is a collection of polygons that cover the edges of
objects that would be bloated, as a path, whose width is twice the
{\it dimen}.  When bloating, the edge template is either added to the
objects being bloated, or clipped from them, depending on the sign of
{\it dimen}.

\item{\bf bits 4-7} (0x70)\\
These three bits specify the corner ``fill-in'' mode, used when
constructing the edge template.  Consider a vertex and two adjacent
edges.  Imagine the rectangles formed from these edges by constructing
parallel edges plus and minus {\it dimen} perpendicular to the edges,
and using the four endpoints of the parallel segments to define two
rectangles.  The two rectangles will overlap, with a notch at the
original vertex location.  Adding a suitable shape to fill in this
notch, thus creating a smooth transition, is the purpose of the corner
fill-in.

The corner fill-in shape has three points initially defined, the
vertex, and the two projections along the ends of the constructed
rectangles.  The differences between the fill-in modes is where (or
if) we add the fourth point to the fill-in polygon.  The choices are
as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{ bits 4-6: 000 (``clip'' mode)}\\
The angle is bisected, and the point added is a distance given
by the absolute value of {\it dimen} from the vertex, along
the bisector.  This produces a rounding effect at the corner.

\item{bits 4-6: 001 (``flat'' mode)}\\
No fourth point is added, only a triangle formed by the existing three
points is used.

\item{bits 4-6: 010 (``extend'' mode)}\\
The point added is the projected intersection of the outer edges of
the two rectangles.  For acute angles, the distance to the extended
vertex is unconstrained.

\item{bits 4-6: 011 (``extend-1'' mode)}\\
The point added is the projected intersection of the outer edges of
the two rectangles.  For acute angles, if the corner would extend too
far, is is clipped (similar to the "clip" mode).

\item{bits 4-6: 100 (``extend-2'' mode)}\\
This mode is similar to the "extend-1" mode, but provides a different
and more aggressive clipping of acute angles. 

\item{bits 4-6: 101 (unused)}\\
This code is reserved for expansion, produces no corner fill.

\item{bits 4-6: 110 (unused)}\\
This code is reserved for expansion, produces no corner fill.

\item{bits 4-6: 111 (no fill)}\\
This produces no corner fill.                                
\end{description}

Small angles will use the ``flat'' corner fill mode to avoid adding
unnecessary vertices, in all modes.

\item{\bf bit 7} (0x80)\\
When using the ``extend'' corner modes, it is possible in certain
geometries that the extended corner will occur on the opposite side of
an edge rectangle from some other edge, which will produce unexpected
features in the bloating result.  In order to prevent this, a rather
expensive test is performed.  Setting this bit will skip the test,
speeding up the operation somewhat.  In Manhattan geometry, this test
can always be skipped.

\item{\bf bit 8} (0x100)\\
Internally, the grouping operation that is part of the preparation for
the edge template generation is skipped.  This is an internal
artifact, and this flag should not be set.  However, if only a single
object is being bloated, this flag may provide a slight speed
improvement.

\item{\bf bit 9} (0x200)\\
Internally, clipping/merging of the trapezoid list passed to the
bloating function is skipped.  This is an internal artifact and this
flag should not be set.

\item{\bf bit 10} (0x400)\\
When this bit is set, a scaling algorithm is applied during the
bloating, which very slightly (+/- one internal unit) affects output
coordinates.  This is the result of a very specialized customer
request that output exactly match that from another tool, and is not
likely to be generally useful.

The scale fix will provide more accurate bloating when all angles are
multiples of 45 degrees.  It is not needed for Manhattan geometry, and
for angles other than 45 degree multiples, it can actually reduce
accuracy.  For best accuracy in the all-angle case, the {\et
DatabaseResolution} variable can be set to a larger value.

\item{\bf bit 11} (0x800)\\
When this bit is set, the trapezoid collection used to define the edge
template will not be clipped and merged before use.  This is an
internal artifact and this flag should not be set.

\item{\bf bit 12} (0x1000)\\
When this bit is set, the resulting trapezoid collection produced for
the edge template or by the bloating operation will not be joined into
polygons.

\end{description}

The basic algorithm for modes 0-2 works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The collection of objects to bloat is converted to a trapezoid
    representation.}
\item{The resulting trapezoid list is grouped into multiple lists of
    spatially disjoint lists, where each list is mutually connected   
    and no trapezoid touches or overlaps a trapezoid from another list.}
\item{For each list, the line segments representing the trapezoid edges
    are tabulated.}
\item{The edge list is clipped against itself to remove mutually
    overlapping regions.  The remaining edges are the ``external''
    edges, where one side is area outside of the trapezoid group.}
\item{Each edge is converted to a rectangle that covers the edge and
    extends $+/-$ the bloat width normal from the edge (note that these
    rectangles are rotated by an arbitrary angle, depending on the
    angle of the line segment).}
\item{The rectangles are converted to trapezoids.  The non-Manhattan
    rotated rectangles are represented by three trapezoids.}
\item{A polygon, implemented as trapezoids, is added at each vertex,
    to fill in the transition between edge segments.  The list of all
    these trapezoids represents a path along the external edges of the
    original trapezoid group.}
\item{If the bloat value is positive, the edge list is or'ed with
    the original trapezoid list.  If the bloat value is negative, the
    edge list is clipped from the original trapezoid group.  If bit 3
    is set, this step is skipped, and the edge list is passed to the
    next step.}
\item{The resulting trapezoid list is merged into polygons,
    representing the operation result.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
\item{\bf bloat mode 0}\\
    If a trapezoid group is entirely Manhattan, meaning that all edges
    are horizontal or vertical, no corner vertex fill-in takes place.
    Instead, the vertical line segments are extended by the (positive)
    bloat dimension.  Thus, bloated Manhattan objects always remain
    Manhattan.

    Otherwise, the polygon to fill the empty area at a vertex between
    the segment rectangles is computed, according to the corner
    fill-in mode.  This may add vertices to the resulting figures,
    giving rounded corners.

\item{\bf bloat mode 1}\\
    This mode is faster, but is not recommended for non-Manhattan
    geometry.  The vertical segment ends are extended by the bloat
    dimension to cover (assumed) Manhattan corners.  Non-Manhattan
    segments are added as a single trapezoid with a width computed
    from the bloat dimension.  Note that this can cause small
    protrusions and other anomalies to appear after bloating.

\item{\bf bloat mode 2}\\
    This is the same as bloat mode 0, however the corners of Manhattan
    and non-Manhattan objects will be treated the same.  The corners
    of positive-bloated boxes may be rounded, unlike mode 0.

\item{\bf bloat mode 3}\\
    This mode uses the DRC sizing functions to perform the bloating
    operation, with results similar to mode 2.  All of the other flags
    except for bit 3 (edge template) are ignored with this choice.  If
    bit 3 is set, an edge template is created, extending out of the
    original figure if the bloat value is positive, or inward if the
    bloat value is negative.

    This mode works best if a {\cb !join} is performed before the
    bloat.  This algorithm is rather compute intensive and slower than
    the other algorithms.  In this algorithm, parts of edges that
    touch an object on the same layer will not be moved, whether or
    not the adjacent object was selected.  In the other algorithms,
    unselected objects are completely ignored.
\end{description}

Presently, if bit 2 is set, the ``old'' algorithms will be used. 
These give results similar to the new algorithms, but are slower.

\begin{description}
\item{\bf old mode 0}\\
In the description, we assume that the object is being expanded, i.e.,
the {\it dimen} is greater than zero.  For each edge, an extension out
of the object normal to the edge is created.  For each corner where
the edge projections do not overlap, a 4-sided polygon is created. 
Three of the vertices are the figure corner vertex and the ends of the
two adjacent projections.  The fourth vertex is placed along the
bisector of the angle formed by the other three vertices, a distance
{\it dimen} from the object corner vertex.  All of the projections are
joined to the original object to create the expanded object.  Note
that the corners become rounded, i.e., bloated rectangles become
polygons.  Figure \ref{bloatfig} illustrates the algorithm.

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{bloatfig} The default algorithm used in the {\cb !bloat}
command to enlarge an object.}
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{center}
\epsfbox{images/bloat.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

If the {\it dimen} is less than zero, the object will be shrunk.  In
this case, the projections extend into the object, and the new object
is formed by clipping these regions from the object.

\item{\bf old mode 1}\\
This algorithm works with a trapezoid decomposition of the objects to
be modified.  An expansion is very fast, but a shrink requires
polarity inversion of the trapezoid list, so is somewhat slower.  This
algorithm is not really recommended for non-Manhattan geometry, since
in working at the trapezoid level without considering adjacency, small
artifacts are often introduced at non-Manhattan corners.

The algorithm takes the following steps:
\begin{description}
\item{If {\it dimen} $>$ 0 (expanding):}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Decompose all selected objects on a given layer into a
trapezoid list.}
\item{Create a second list containing trapezoids derived from the
edges of trapezoids in the first list, created to enclose each edge
and the surrounding area to $+/-$ {\it dimen} normal to the edge.}
\item{Merge the two lists and join into polygons.}
\end{enumerate}

\item{If {\it dimen} $<$ 0 (shrinking):}\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Decompose all selected objects on a given layer into a
trapezoid list.}
\item{Invert the list in a rectangle that encloses all trapezoids
bloated by {\it dimen}.}
\item{Create an edge trapezoid list from the inverted list.}
\item{Clip out the regions of the original list that overlap
trapezoids in the edge list.}
\item{Merge the resulting list into polygons.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\item{\bf old mode 2}\\
In this algorithm, for {\it dimen} larger than 0, the objects are
first joined into maximal polygons, i.e., no two of these polygons
abut or overlap.  The vertex list of each polygon is used to construct
a ``wire'' of width $2*dimen$, which is then converted to a polygon
representation.  The wire polygon covers the edge of the original
polygon, extending by {\it dimen} inside and outside of the figure. 
Each polygon becomes the union of the original polygon and its
``wire'' polygon.  If {\it dimen} is less than zero, the geometry is
inverted first as in the previous algorithm.  Thus, the edge ``wires''
around the clear areas are found.  These are clipped from the dark
areas, yielding the final figures.  Without the inversion, polygons
with holes would not be processed correctly.

Note that bloating modes 1 and 2 will not round the corners, i.e.,
Manhattan corners remain Manhattan.

    <p>
    This command will merge boxes, polygons, and optionally wires into
    complex polygons.  Use of merged geometry can reduce memory use
    and the size of the layout data file.

    <p>
    The <b>Join</b>, <b>Join Lyr</b>, and <b>Join All</b> buttons in
    the <b>Join or Split Objects</b> panel from the <a
    href="xic:join"><b>Join/Split</b></a> button in the <b>Edit
    Menu</b> provide an equivalent to the <b>!join</b> command.

    <p>
    There are three basic operating modes.  The <b>!join</b> command
    without arguments will join only selected objects.  With the
    "layer" argument, all objects on the current layer may be joined,
    With the "all" argument, objects on any layer may be joined.  In
    these two cases, objects will be joined whether selected or not. 
    For the arguments, the traditional "<tt>-</tt>" is actually
    optional, and only the first letter is considered, case
    insensitive.  So, "<tt>!join -a</tt>", "<tt>!join All</tt>", and
    "<tt>!join apple</tt>" are all equivalent.

    <p>
    If a layer has the <a href="NoMerge"><tt>NoMerge</tt></a> keyword
    applied, in general joining (merging) is forbidden on the layer. 
    However, this is overridden by the <b>!join</b> command without
    arguments.  In this mode, the user must select the objects to
    join, and it is assumed that the user really wants them joined. 
    In the other modes, objects on layers with this keyword set will
    <b>not</b> be joined.  The user must first remove the keyword with
    the <a href="xic:lpedt"><b>Tech Parameter Editor</b></a> from the
    <b>Attributes Menu</b>, or otherwise.

    <p>
    In any case, the layer must be visible.  With the "all" option,
    the layer must also be selectable.

    <p>
    The <b>!join</b> command, the <b>Join</b>, <b>Join Lyr</b>, and
    <b>Join All</b> buttons, the <a href="Join"><tt>Join</tt></a>, <a
    href="JoinObjects"><tt>JoinObjects</tt></a>, and <a
    href="GroupObjects"><tt>GroupObjects</tt></a> script functions,
    and other commands such as <a href="!layer"><b>!layer</b></a>
    which perform a join operation, are sensitive to four variables
    which fine-tune the behavior and performance.  The default values
    emphasize speed but limit the complexity of resulting polygons. 
    The user may need to set one or more of these variables in order
    for the operation to meet requirements.  These variables can be
    set from the <b>Join or Split Objects</b> panel, using the
    analogous controls.

    <p>
    In addition, the <a
    href="JoinSplitWires"><b>JoinSplitWires</b></a> variable, which
    also has a corresponding check box in the <b>Join or Split
    Objects</b> panel, determines whether wires are included in join
    operations.  By default, wires do not participate in the join,
    however if the variable (or equivalently, the check box) is set,
    wires will behave the same as polygons.

    <p>
    To join a set of objects, the first step internally is to
    decompose each object onto a collection of trapezoids.  As the
    objects are decomposed, the trapezoids are added to a list, which
    will be sent on to the function which performs the join.  The
    variable <a href="JoinMaxPolyQueue"><b>JoinMaxPolyQueue</b></a>
    sets the limit on the number of trapezoids that can accumulate
    before the list is processed.  All or none of the trapezoids from
    a given object are added to the list, i.e., objects are not broken
    up at this point.  If the addition of the trapezoids would cause
    the list to exceed the limit, then the list is sent on for
    processing, and a new list started.  If <b>JoinMaxPolyQueue</b> is
    set to 0, there is no limit, and only a single list will be
    processed.  When this variable is not set, the effective default
    value is 0 (no limit).

    <p>
    When a list is sent on for processing, the first operation is to
    break up the list into groups.  Each group contains one or more
    trapezoids, such that the trapezoids in each group are
    "connected", i.e., the aggregate forms a single figure.  The
    variable <a href="JoinMaxPolyGroup"><b>JoinMaxPolyGroup</b></a>
    specifies a limit on the number of trapezoids in any single group. 
    If this limit is reached, no additional trapezoids are added,
    instead they are placed in a new group or possibly some other
    existing group.  If this variable is set to 0, then no limit is
    applied, and in this case all groups are guaranteed to be
    disjoint.  When this variable is not set, the effective default
    value is 0 (no limit).

    <p>
    For each group, one or more polygons are created, which exactly
    cover the area of the trapezoids.  The variable <a
    href="JoinMaxPolyVerts"><b>JoinMaxPolyVerts</b></a> specifies a
    limit on the number of vertices which can appear in any single
    polygon.  Thus, if the limit is reached, more than one polygon
    will be generated.  If this variable is set to 0, then no limit is
    applied, and a single polygon will be created for each group. 
    When this variable is not set, the effective default value is 600.

    <p>
    When the effective value of <b>JoinMaxPolyVerts</b> is nonzero,
    the <a href="JoinBreakClean"><b>JoinBreakClean</b></a> variable
    determines now the partitioning is done.  If this variable is not
    set, then the polygons are built up by adding trapezoids until the
    vertex limit is reached, at which point a new polygon is started,
    and constructed using the remaining trapezoids.  The process
    continues until all trapezoids have been included in a polygon. 
    The resulting collection of polygons may have complicated
    boundaries that interleave in a rather random way.

    <p>
    If <b>JoinBreakClean</b> is set, the vertex limit is initially
    ignored, and a single polygon is created from all of the
    trapezoids.  If the vertex limit is exceeded, the polygon is split
    in two pieces, either horizontally or vertically.  If either piece
    still exceeds the limit, it is subdivided in the same way, and so
    on until all polygons are within the limit.  In this case, the
    boundaries are Manhattan.  This processing is more
    compute-intensive than the other approach, but provides a better
    looking layout.
!!LATEX !join bangcmds.tex

Syntax: {\vt !join} [{\vt -l} {\vt |} {\vt -a}]
\end{quote}

This command will merge boxes, polygons, and optionally wires into
complex polygons.  Use of merged geometry can reduce memory use and
the size of the layout data file.

The {\cb Join}, {\cb Join Lyr}, and {\cb Join All} buttons in the {\cb
Join or Split Objects} panel from the {\cb Join/Split} button in the
{\cb Edit Menu} provide an equivalent to the {\cb !join} command.

There are three basic operating modes.  The {\cb !join} command
without arguments will join only selected objects.  With the ``layer''
argument, all objects on the current layer may be joined, With the
``all'' argument, objects on any layer may be joined.' In these two
cases, objects will be joined whether selected or not.  For the
arguments, the traditional ``{\vt -}'' is actually optional, and only
the first letter is considered, case insensitive, So, ``{\vt !join
-a}'', ``{\vt !join All}'', and ``{\vt !join apple}'' are all
equivalent.

\index{NoMerge keyword}
If a layer has the {\vt NoMerge} keyword applied, in general joining
(merging) is forbidden on the layer.  However, this is overridden by
the {\cb !join} command without arguments.  In this mode, the user
must select the objects to join, and it is assumed that the user
really wants them joined.  In the other modes, objects on layers with
this keyword set will {\bf not} be joined.  The user must first remove
the keyword with the {\cb Tech Parameter Editor} from the {\cb
Attributes Menu}, or otherwise.

In any case, the layer must be visible.  With the ``all'' option, the
layer must also be selectable.

The {\cb !join} command, the {\cb Join}, {\cb Join Lyr}, and {\cb Join
All} buttons, the {\vt Join}, {\vt JoinObjects} and {\vt GroupObjects}
script functions, and other commands such as {\cb !layer} which
perform a join operation, are sensitive to four variables which
fine-tune the behavior and performance.  The default values emphasize
speed but limit the complexity of resulting polygons.  The user may
need to set one or more of these variables in order for the operation
to meet requirements.  These variables can be set from the {\cb Join
or Split Objects} panel, using the analogous controls.

In addition, the {\cb JoinSplitWires} variable, which also has a
corresponding check box in the {\cb Join or Split Objects} panel,
determines whether wires are included in join operations.  By default,
wires do not participate in the join, however if the variable (or
equivalently, the check box) is set, wires will behave the same as
polygons.

To join a set of objects, the first step internally is to decompose
each object onto a collection of trapezoids.  As the objects are
decomposed, the trapezoids are added to a list, which will be sent on
to the function which performs the join.  The variable {\et
JoinMaxPolyQueue} sets the limit on the number of trapezoids that can
accumulate before the list is processed.  All or none of the
trapezoids from a given object are added to the list, i.e., objects
are not broken up at this point.  If the addition of the trapezoids
would cause the list to exceed the limit, then the list is sent on for
processing, and a new list started.  If {\et JoinMaxPolyQueue} is set
to 0, there is no limit, and only a single list will be processed. 
When this variable is not set, the effective default value is 0 (no
limit).

When a list is sent on for processing, the first operation is to break
up the list into groups.  Each group contains one or more trapezoids,
such that the trapezoids in each group are ``connected'', i.e., the
aggregate forms a single figure.  The variable {\et JoinMaxPolyGroup}
specifies a limit on the number of trapezoids in any single group.  If
this limit is reached, no additional trapezoids are added, instead
they are placed in a new group or possibly some other existing group. 
If this variable is set to 0, then no limit is applied, and in this
case all groups are guaranteed to be disjoint.  When this variable is
not set, the effective default value is 0 (no limit).

For each group, one or more polygons are created, which exactly cover
the area of the trapezoids.  The variable {\et JoinMaxPolyVerts}
specifies a limit on the number of vertices which can appear in any
single polygon.  Thus, if the limit is reached, more than one polygon
will be generated.  If this variable is set to 0, then no limit is
applied, and a single polygon will be created for each group.  When
this variable is not set, the effective default value is 600.

When the effective value of {\et JoinMaxPolyVerts} is nonzero, the
{\et JoinBreakClean} variable determines now the partitioning is done. 
If this variable is not set, then the polygons are built up by adding
trapezoids until the vertex limit is reached, at which point a new
polygon is started, and constructed using the remaining trapezoids. 
The process continues until all trapezoids have been included in a
polygon.  The resulting collection of polygons may have complicated
boundaries that interleave in a rather random way.

If {\et JoinBreakClean} is set, the vertex limit is initially ignored,
and a single polygon is created from all of the trapezoids.  If the
vertex limit is exceeded, the polygon is split in two pieces, either
horizontally or vertically.  If either piece still exceeds the limit,
it is subdivided in the same way, and so on until all polygons are
within the limit.  In this case, the boundaries are Manhattan.  This
processing is more compute-intensive than the other approach, but
provides a better looking layout.

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!tospot</tt> [<i>spotsize</i>]</b>

    <p>
    When an e-beam mask is written, the layout is rendered using a
    certain pixel size (known as the "spot size") set by the e-beam
    equipment.  This size may be as large as 0.5 microns but is
    typically much smaller, with smaller sizes providing higher
    resolution, but taking longer to write and therefor costing more. 
    There can be numerical problems in "rasterizing" round objects to
    the e-beam grid.  Since the round object is rendered as a
    collection of spot-pixels, the feature is not particularly round,
    but most importantly the number of pixels used may not be well
    defined, and therefor the figure area may not be as expected, or
    vary depending on position or rotation.

    <p>
    The <b>!tospot</b> command will apply an algorithm (described
    below) to all selected polygons.  The <i>spotsize</i>, if given,
    is the spot size to use in microns.  Values up to 1.0 micron are
    accepted.  If not given, the value is taken from the <a
    href="SpotSize"><b>SpotSize</b></a> variable, or the value of the
    <a href="MfgGrid"><tt>MfgGrid</tt></a> from the technology file if
    <b>SpotSize</b> is not set.
 
    <a name="algo"></a>
    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
 
    The algorithm is intended to translate small objects with many
    vertices to a representation which will pass unchanged through
    e-beam rasterization.  This will in general change the shape of an
    object, to something close to that which will be rendered on the
    mask. 
 
    <p>
    The algorithm uses the following logic: 
 
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find the bounding box of the figure.
    <p>
    <li>Snap the box edges to the nearest spot boundaries.
    <p>
    <li>If the center of the bounding box has changed, apply the same offset
       to the figure to keep it centered in the new bounding box.
    <p>
    <li>Shrink the box by 1/2 of the spot size.
    <p>
    <li>Clip the figure to the new bounding box.
    <p>
    <li>For each vertex, move the vertex to the center of the closest spot.
    <p>
    <li>Remove duplicate vertices.
    <p>
    <li>Save the modified figure in the database.
    </ol>

    <p>
    Following application of the algorithm, each vertex of the figure
    is centered in an e-beam spot, so it is unlikely that round-off or
    other error will cause the figure to change during rasterization.

    <a name="cmts"></a>
    <h2>Comments and Warnings</h2>

    The algorithm is intended for unconnected, nonconducting objects
    such as vias.  It should not in general be applied to wiring
    objects, since it will generate small gaps between processed
    objects which were originally touching, which will cause the
    extraction functions to detect that the objects are disconnected.

    <p>
    Although the object is shown on-screen as a polygon, The actual
    rendered object will be composed of pixels.  The size of the
    object on-screen is therefor one spot-size smaller than the
    rendered size (since half of the spot for each edge is not shown).

    <p>
    Applying <b>!tospot</b> to circular objects created with a
    <b>SpotSize</b> is <i>not</i> the same as creating the circular
    object with the <a href="xic:round"><b>round</b></a> or <a

When using {\cb !tospot} on round objects created without {\et

will be empty after the operation.  The coordinates of the objects are
the same after the move, with respect to the origin of the current
cell.  This operation is not undoable.

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!compare</tt> <i>arguments</i></b>

    <p>
    This function compares the geometry and instance placements in
    cells from two cell hierarchies, or between a cell hierarchy and
    cells in memory, or between cells in memory.  It is also possible
    to compare properties of cells, cell instances, and objects.  The
    results are written to a log file.  It is used as a back-end for
    the <a href="xic:diff"><b>Compare Layouts</b></a> panel, and can
    be used directly.

    <p>
    There are three basic comparison modes.  The per-cell object mode
    compares cell content object-to-object.  A difference will be
    indicated if a given object does not have an exact counterpart in
    the other cell.  The per-cell geometry mode does not look at
    objects, but rather considers the area occupied by the objects. 
    Thus, differences will be indicated only if the covered area
    differs.  The third comparison mode logically flattens the
    hierarchy before comparing the geometry.  Thus, differences will
    be indicated only if the flat geometry (i.e., the mask layout)
    differs.

    <p>
    The results are written to a file named "<tt>diff.log</tt>" in the
    current directory.  Each object or region that appears in one cell
    and not the other corresponding cell is written in a CIF-like
    format to the log file, unless the <tt>-d</tt> (diff only) option
    is given.

    <p>
    When the comparison finishes, the user is given the option to view
    the log file.  The <a href="!diffcells"><b>!diffcells</b></a>
    command can be used to create cells from the log file for
    visualizing the differences.

    <a name="common"></a>
    <h2>Common Options</h2>

    There is a large number of
    arguments that can be applied to set various modes and provide
    further input.  These arguments must be given as separate tokens,
    and all start with a '<tt>-</tt>' symbol.  The following options
    apply to all comparison modes.

    <p>
    <dl><dt><tt>-f1</tt> <i>source1</i><dd>
    This is the "left" source.  It is either the name of an <a
    href="xic:fsaf">archive file</a>, or the access name of a <a
    href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) in memory, or a
    path to a CHD file.  This argument is not mandatory, and if
    missing implies that cells listed for the left source are found in
    main memory.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-f2</tt> <i>source2</i><dd>
    This is the "right" source.  It is either the name of an <a
    href="xic:fsaf">archive file</a>, or the access name of a <a
    href="xic:hier">Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) in memory, or a
    path to a CHD file.  This argument is not mandatory, and if
    missing implies that cells listed for the right source are found
    in main memory.
    </dl>

    <p>
    For backward compatibility, the "<tt>-f1</tt>" and "<tt>-f2</tt>"
    are optional.  If otherwise unassociated strings appear in the
    command line, the first will be taken as if given with
    <tt>-f1</tt>, the second (if any) will be taken as if given with
    <tt>-f2</tt>.

    <p>
    If a layout file name is given as a source, a temporary CHD will
    be created in memory and destroyed on command exit.  Thus for
    repeated comparisons using the same file, it is more efficient to
    create the CHD first, and pass its name to this command.

    <dl><dt><tt>-c1</tt> <i>cellname ...</i><dd>
    This is a list of cell names found in the left source.  If more
    than one name appears, the list should be quoted using
    double-quote marks.  If no left source was given, the names should
    match cells in memory.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-c2</tt> <i>cellname ...</i><dd>
    This is a list of equivalent cell names found in the right source. 
    If more than one name appears, the list should be quoted using
    double-quote marks.  If no right source was given, the names
    should match cells in memory.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The actual list of cells to compare is generated by logic to be
    described.  The left source is taken as the "reference" for cell
    list creation.

    <p>
    In many cases, there is only one list of cells to compare (given
    in <tt>-c1</tt>), and each cell is sought in both sources.  If a
    cell is found in one source and not the other, this will appear in
    the log file, but is not considered to be an error.

    <p>
    If a <tt>-c2</tt> "equivalence" list is given, there must be
    exactly the same number of entries as given in the <tt>-c1</tt>
    list.  The cells in the two lists will be compared term-by-term,
    in order.  This is how one can compare cells with differing names. 
    In all other cases, the <tt>-c2</tt> list should not appear.  It
    is an error if <tt>-c2</tt> is given without <tt>-c1</tt>, or the
    list lengths differ.  However, the <tt>-c2</tt> list is ignored if
    in a per-cell comparison mode and the <tt>-h</tt> (recurse) option
    is given.

    <p>
    The interpretation of a non-existing <tt>-c1</tt> list depends on
    the comparison mode.  If in flat comparison mode, or in a per-cell
    mode and the <tt>-h</tt> (recurse) option is given, then the
    effective cell list contains only the default cell from the left
    source.  If this was a CHD name, the default cell is the one <a
    href="xic:chdconfig">configured</a> into the CHD, or the first
    top-level cell found in the source file.  In the other cases, a
    missing <tt>-c1</tt> list is interpreted as all cells found in the
    left source.

    <p>
    In the special case that neither a left or right source is
    specified, then the <tt>-c1</tt> and <tt>-c2</tt> lists can not be
    empty, and the names are cells in memory to compare.

    <p>
    In the per-cell modes with <tt>-h</tt> (recurse) option given,
    each entry in the <tt>-c1</tt> list is hierarchically expanded to
    a full list of the cells under the given cell, and these names are
    merged into a new list that contains no duplicates.  If no
    <tt>-c1</tt> list was given, per the discussion above, the cell
    list is effectively the hierarchy of the default cell from the
    left source.  The recurse option can not be used unless a left
    source is specified, i.e., the left cells can't be from memory.

    <dl><dt><tt>-l</tt> <i>layer_list</i><dd>
     The <i>layer_list</i> is a space-separated list of layer names,
     which must be quoted if more than one layer appears.  If no
     <i>layer_list</i> is given, all layers will be checked for
     differences.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-s</tt><dd>
    If a <i>layer_list</i> is given, differences will be recorded in
    all layers <b>except</b> the layers in the <i>layer_list</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-d</tt><dd>
    Don't record the actual differences, only whether or not the cells
    differ.  This only accounts for geometrical differences,
    properties are ignored.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-r</tt> <i>max_diffs</i><dd>
    The integer <i>max_diffs</i> sets the maximum number of
    differences to allow before the comparison terminates.  If not
    given or given a value 0, there is no limit.  Beware that errors
    in the cell list could potentially lead to enormous output, so it
    is usually advisable to put a limit on the number of differences
    recorded.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The following options set the comparison mode.  The per-cell
    comparison modes are generally faster and use less memory than the
    flat mode, since only the geometry from the two cells being
    compared is called into memory.  The flat mode is required if the
    two layouts have differences in hierarchy.

    <p>
    <dl><dt><tt>-g</tt><dd>
    When <tt>-g</tt> is given, per-cell geometric comparison is used.
    All "real" objects (boxes, polygons and wires) are considered when
    comparing geometry, text labels are ignored.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-f</tt><dd>
    The <tt>-f</tt> option indicates flat comparison mode, and will
    supersede <tt>-g</tt> if also given.  In flat comparison mode,
    geometry is logically flattened before comparison.
    </dl>

    <p>
    If neither <tt>-f</tt> or <tt>-g</tt> appears in the argument list,
    per-cell object mode is used.

    <a name="pco"></a>
    <h2>Per-Cell Object Mode Options</h2>

    <dl><dt><tt>-t</tt> <i>obj_types</i><dd>
    The <i>obj_types</i> is a word containing any or all of the
    letters <tt>c,b,p,w,l</tt> which indicate cells, boxes, polygons,
    wires, and labels.  The letters indicate the types of objects that
    will be considered.  If this option is not given, the default is
    "<tt>cbpw</tt>", i.e., labels are ignored.

    <p>
    Comparison of labels can lead to false differences when comparing
    cells read from different file formats, since label bounding boxes
    are not well defined across file format conversion.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-b</tt><dd>
    When given, a two-vertex wire or four-vertex polygon that is
    rendered as a Manhattan rectangle will match a rectangle object
    with the same dimensions.  Thus, files that have had these
    features converted to boxes to save space can be directly
    compared, without a lot of spurious entries in output.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-n</tt><dd>
    When given, if duplicate objects are present in one or both of the
    files, unmatched duplicates will not be reported if one of the
    duplicates has a match.  Thus files with duplicates removed can be
    compared with the original file, and the duplicates will not
    appear in output as differences.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-x</tt><dd>
    Expand subcell arrays (if comparing subcells).  Cell arrays are
    converted to individual placements before comparison, avoiding
    false errors between arrayed and equivalent unarrayed layouts.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-h</tt><dd>
    The cell list is expanded so that all cells in the hierarchy under
    the given cells are compared.  The left source is used to extract
    the hierarchy cells.  The left source must have been specified,
    this option does no apply if the left cells are in memory.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-e</tt><dd>
    If <tt>-e</tt> is given, electrical cells will be compared. 
    Otherwise, physical cells are compared.
    </dl>

    <p>
    Property comparisons are available only in per-cell object mode. 
    Property lists of cells, instances, and objects can be filtered by
    property number and compared.  Only the property lists of
    otherwise identical instances or objects will be compared. 
    Property comparison is turned off by default, but can be enabled
    with the <tt>-p</tt> option.

    <dl><dt><tt>-p</tt> <i>spec_word</i><dd>
    This option will set up property list comparison, which is
    available in per-cell object comparison mode.  The
    <i>spec_word</i> is a collection of characters from the list
    below, order is unimportant.
  
    <dl><dt><tt>b, p, w, l, c, s</tt><dd>
    The presence of these letters enables property list comparison
    between boxes, polygons, wires, labels, instances, and cells.  The
    indicated object type or instance must also be enabled for
    checking with the <tt>-t</tt> option or by default, or the letter
    is ignored.  The <tt>s</tt> character will always enable
    comparison of the property lists of the two source cells.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>n,u</tt><dd>
    These two letters control the filtering applied to property lists
    before comparison.  The filters limit the properties to compare. 
    If <tt>n</tt> is given, no filtering is applied, so that all
    properties will be considered.  This overrides <tt>u</tt> (below)
    if both are given.

    <p>
    If <tt>u</tt> is given, custom filtering will be applied.  There
    are separate filters available for properties of cells, instances,
    and objects, for both physical and electrical comparisons.  Custom
    filtering can be set up through the <a
    href="xic:prpfilt"><b>Custom Property Filter Setup</b></a> panel,
    or by directly setting the corresponding variables.  See the
    description of the panel for complete information.

    <p>
    If neither of these letters appear, default filtering is applied. 
    For physical data, the default filtering action is no filtering. 
    For electrical data, filtering is applied to cell and instance
    properties, and object properties are ignored, so that difference
    reporting applies to user-defined properties only.
    </dl>
    </dl>

    <p>
    Properties are compared by number and string.  In the output file,
    property comparison result lines are all in comment form (with
    '<tt>#</tt>' as the first character) so that they will be ignored
    if the file is subsequently processed with the <a
    href="!diffcells"><b>!diffcells</b></a> command.  Property
    comparison results consist of a string indicating the cell,
    instance, or object containing the properties.  If an instance or
    object, this is common to both input sources.  Following this are
    listings of properties found in one source and not the other. 
    Properties that are identical in the two sources are not listed.

    <a name="pcg"></a>
    <h2>Per-Cell Geometry Mode Options</h2>

    All of the options for per-cell object mode are available and have
    the same function, except that the only code that is considered
    for <tt>-t</tt> is "<tt>c</tt>".  By default, subcell checking is
    not enabled.  If enabled ("<tt>-t c</tt>" is given), then subcell
    placements are checked as in per-cell object mode.

    <p>
    When using per-cell geometry mode, the geometry is compared
    within areas of a grid whose size is given by the <a
    href="PartitionSize"><b>PartitionSize</b></a> variable. 
    Experimenting with this size can lead to improved speed, depending
    on the layout density.  The default partition size is 100 microns. 
    For best performance, this can be increased for low density, or
    reduced for high density, where "density" refers to the number of
    trapezoids per area.

    <a name="flat"></a>
    <h2>Flat Mode Options</h2>

    None of the per-cell options apply in flat mode, though with the
    exception of <tt>-e</tt> if given they will be benignly ignored. 
    Flat mode applies only to physical data, and if <tt>-e</tt> is
    given, an error will result.

    <p>
    In flat mode, both <i>source</i> tokens must be provided, as flat
    comparison to memory cells is not available.

    <p>
    <dl><dt><tt>-a</tt> <i>L,B,R,T</i><dd>
    The <tt>-a</tt> option specifies the rectangular area where
    comparison is performed.  If not given, comparison is performed
    over the entire cell area of both cells.  The word that follows
    <tt>-a</tt> consists of the four rectangle coordinate values, in
    microns, separated by commas.  There can be no white space.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The flat geometry mode is somewhat orthogonal to the other
    modes.  The algorithm uses two levels of gridding to partition the
    layout into pieces, and directly compares the geometry in each
    fine grid cell.  This is very similar to the algorithm described
    for the <a
    href="ChdIterateOverRegion"><tt>ChdIterateOverRegion</tt></a>
    script function.

    <p>
    <dl><dt><tt>-i</tt> <i>fine_grid</i><dd>
    This sets the size of the fine grid used for comparison.  The
    geometry in each fine grid cell is compared.  The value is in
    microns in the range 1.0 - 100.0, if not given 20.0 is used.
    </dl>

    <dl><dt><tt>-m</tt> <i>coarse_mult</i><dd>
    This sets the size of the coarse grid, as an integer multiple of
    the fine grid size.  The coarse grid size is the chunk size for
    reading geometry into memory.  Once in memory, the geometry is
    split into the fine grid cells and compared.  Using too large of a
    coarse grid can cause memory exhaustion for dense layouts, but on
    the other hand a larger coarse grid size usually improves speed. 
    The user should experiment to find the best values for the fine
    and coarse grid for their layouts.  The acceptable range for this
    parameter is 1 - 100.  If not given, 20 is used.
    </dl>

\begin{quote}
Syntax: {\vt !compare} {\it arguments}
\end{quote}
This function compares the geometry and instance placements in cells
from two cell hierarchies, or between a cell hierarchy and cells in
memory, or between cells in memory.  It is also possible to compare
properties of cells, cell instances, and objects.  The results are
written to a log file.  It is used as a back-end for the {\cb Compare
Layouts} panel, and can be used directly.

There are three basic comparison modes.  The per-cell object mode
compares cell content object-to-object.  A difference will be
indicated if a given object does not have an exact counterpart in the
other cell.  The per-cell geometry mode does not look at objects, but
rather considers the area occupied by the objects.  Thus, differences
will be indicated only if the covered area differs.  The third
comparison mode logically flattens the hierarchy before comparing the
geometry.  Thus, differences will be indicated only if the flat
geometry (i.e., the mask layout) differs.

The results are written to a file named ``{\vt diff.log}'' in the
current directory.  Each object or region that appears in one cell and
not the other corresponding cell is written in a CIF-like format to
the log file, unless the {\vt -d} (diff only) option is given.

When the comparison finishes, the user is given the option to view the
log file.  The {\cb !diffcells} command can be used to create cells
from the log file for visualizing the differences.

\subsubsection{Common Options}

There is a large number of arguments that can be applied to set
various modes and provide further input.  These arguments must be
given as separate tokens, and all start with a `{\vt -}' symbol.  The
following options apply to all comparison modes.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -f1} {\it source1\/}}\\
This is the ``left'' source.  It is either the name of an archive
file, or the access name of a Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) in memory,
or a path to a CHD file.  This argument is not mandatory, and if
missing implies that cells listed for the left source are found in
main memory.

\item{{\vt -f2} {\it source2\/}}\\
This is the "right" source.  It is either the name of an archive file,
or the access name of a Cell Hierarchy Digest (CHD) in memory, or a
path to a CHD file.  This argument is not mandatory, and if missing
implies that cells listed for the right source are found in main
memory.
\end{description}

For backward compatibility, the ``{\vt -f1}'' and ``{\vt -f2}'' are
optional.  If otherwise unassociated strings appear in the command
line, the first will be taken as if given with {\vt -f1}, the second
(if any) will be taken as if given with {\vt -f2}.

If a layout file name is given as a source, a temporary CHD will be
created in memory and destroyed on command exit.  Thus for repeated
comparisons using the same file, it is more efficient to create the
CHD first, and pass its name to this command.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -c1} {\it cellname\/} ...}\\
This is a list of cell names found in the left source.  If more than
one name appears, the list should be quoted using double-quote marks. 
If no left source was given, the names should match cells in memory.

\item{{\vt -c2} {\it cellname\/} ...}\\
This is a list of equivalent cell names found in the right source.  If
more than one name appears, the list should be quoted using
double-quote marks.  If no right source was given, the names should
match cells in memory.
\end{description}

The actual list of cells to compare is generated by logic to be
described.  The left source is taken as the ``reference'' for cell
list creation.

In many cases, there is only one list of cells to compare (given in
{\vt -c1}), and each cell is sought in both sources.  If a cell is
found in one source and not the other, this will appear in the log
file, but is not considered to be an error.

If a {\vt -c2} ``equivalence'' list is given, there must be exactly
the same number of entries as given in the {\vt -c1} list.  The cells
in the two lists will be compared term-by-term, in order.  This is how
one can compare cells with differing names.  In all other cases, the
{\vt -c2} list should not appear.  It is an error if {\vt -c2} is
given without {\vt -c1}, or the list lengths differ.  However, the
{\vt -c2} list is ignored if in a per-cell comparison mode and the
{\vt -h} (recurse) option is given.

The interpretation of a non-existing {\vt -c1} list depends on the
comparison mode.  If in flat comparison mode, or in a per-cell mode
and the {\vt -h} (recurse) option is given, then the effective cell
list contains only the default cell from the left source.  If this was
a CHD name, the default cell is the one configured into the CHD, or
the first top-level cell found in the source file.  In the other
cases, a missing {\vt -c1} list is interpreted as all cells found in
the left source.

In the special case that neither a left or right source is specified,
then the {\vt -c1} and {\vt -c2} lists can not be empty, and the names
are cells in memory to compare.

In the per-cell modes with {\vt -h} (recurse) option given, each entry
in the {\vt -c1} list is hierarchically expanded to a full list of the
cells under the given cell, and these names are merged into a new list
that contains no duplicates.  If no {\vt -c1} list was given, per the
discussion above, the cell list is effectively the hierarchy of the
default cell from the left source.  The recurse option can not be used
unless a left source is specified, i.e., the left cells can't be from
memory.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -l} {\it layer\_list}}\\
The {\it layer\_list} is a space-separated list of layer names, which
must be quoted if more than one layer appears.  If no {\it
layer\_list} is given, all layers will be checked for differences.

\item{\vt -s}\\
If a {\it layer\_list} is given, differences will be recorded in all
layers {\bf except} the layers in the {\it layer\_list}.

\item{\vt -d}\\
Don't record the actual differences, only whether or not the cells
differ.  This only accounts for geometrical differences, properties
are ignored.

\item{{\vt -r} {\it max\_diffs}}\\
The integer {\it max\_diffs} sets the maximum number of differences to
allow before the comparison terminates.  If not given or given a value
0, there is no limit.  Beware that errors in the cell list could
potentially lead to enormous output, so it is usually advisable to put
a limit on the number of differences recorded.
\end{description}

The following options set the comparison mode.  The per-cell
comparison modes are generally faster and use less memory than the
flat mode, since only the geometry from the two cells being compared
is called into memory.  The flat mode is required if the two layouts
have differences in hierarchy.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt -g}\\
When {\vt -g} is given, per-cell geometric comparison is used.  All
``real'' objects (boxes, polygons and wires) are considered when
comparing geometry, text labels are ignored.

\item{\vt -f}\\
The {\vt -f} option indicates flat comparison mode, and will supersede
{\vt -g} if also given.  In flat comparison mode, geometry is
logically flattened before comparison.
\end{description}

If neither {\vt -f} or {\vt -g} appears in the argument list, per-cell
object mode is used.

\subsubsection{Per-Cell Object Mode Options}

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -t} {\it obj\_types}}\\
The {\it obj\_types} is a word containing any or all of the letters
{\vt c,b,p,w,l} which indicate cells, boxes, polygons, wires, and
labels.  The letters indicate the types of objects that will be
considered.  If this option is not given, the default is ``{\vt
cbpw}'', i.e., labels are ignored.

Comparison of labels can lead to false differences when comparing
cells read from different file formats, since label bounding boxes are
not well defined across file format conversion.

\item{\vt -b}\\
When given, a two-vertex wire or four-vertex polygon that is rendered
as a Manhattan rectangle will match a rectangle object with the same
dimensions.  Thus, files that have had these features converted to
boxes to save space can be directly compared, without a lot of
spurious entries in output.
       
\item{\vt -n}\\
When given, if duplicate objects are present in one or both of the
files, unmatched duplicates will not be reported if one of the
duplicates has a match.  Thus files with duplicates removed can be
compared with the original file, and the duplicates will not appear in
output as differences.

\item{\vt -x}\\
Expand subcell arrays (if comparing subcells).  Cell arrays are
converted to individual placements before comparison, avoiding false
errors between arrayed and equivalent unarrayed layouts.

\item{\vt -h}\\
The cell list is expanded so that all cells in the hierarchy under the
given cells are compared.  The left source is used to extract the
hierarchy cells.  The left source must have been specified, this
option does no apply if the left cells are in memory.

\item{\vt -e}\\
If {\vt -e} is given, electrical cells will be compared.  Otherwise,
physical cells are compared.
\end{description}

Property comparisons are available only in per-cell object mode. 
Property lists of cells, instances, and objects can be filtered by
property number and compared.  Only the property lists of otherwise
identical instances or objects will be compared.  Property comparison
is turned off by default, but can be enabled with the {\vt -p} option.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -p} {\it spec\_word}}\\
This option will set up property list comparison, which is available
in per-cell object comparison mode.  The {\it spec\_word} is a
collection of characters from the list below, order is unimportant.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt b, p, w, l, c, s}\\
The presence of these letters enables property list comparison between
boxes, polygons, wires, labels, instances, and cells.  The indicated
object type or instance must also be enabled for checking with the
{\vt -t} option or by default, or the letter is ignored.  The {\vt s}
character will always enable comparison of the property lists of the
two source cells.

\item{\vt n,u}\\
These two letters control the filtering applied to property lists
before comparison.  The filters limit the properties to compare.  If
{\vt n} is given, no filtering is applied, so that all properties will
be considered.  This overrides {\vt u} (below) if both are given.

If {\vt u} is given, custom filtering will be applied.  There are
separate filters available for properties of cells, instances, and
objects, for both physical and electrical comparisons.  Custom
filtering can be set up through the {\cb Custom Property Filter Setup}
panel, or by directly setting the corresponding variables.  See the
description of the panel in \ref{prpfilt} for complete information.

If neither of these letters appear, default filtering is applied.  For
physical data, the default filtering action is no filtering.  For
electrical data, filtering is applied to cell and instance properties,
and object properties are ignored, so that difference reporting
applies to user-defined properties only.
\end{description}
\end{description}

Properties are compared by number and string.  In the output file,
property comparison result lines are all in comment form (with `{\vt
\#}' as the first character) so that they will be ignored if the file
is subsequently processed with the {\cb !diffcells} command.  Property
comparison results consist of a string indicating the cell, instance,
or object containing the properties.  If an instance or object, this
is common to both input sources.  Following this are listings of
properties found in one source and not the other.  Properties that are
identical in the two sources are not listed.

\subsubsection{Per-Cell Geometry Mode Options}

All of the options for per-cell object mode are available and have the
same function, except that the only code that is considered for {\vt
-t} is ``{\vt c}''.  By default, subcell checking is not enabled.  If
enabled (``{\vt -t c}'' is given), then subcell placements are checked
as in per-cell object mode.

When using per-cell geometry mode, the geometry is compared within
areas of a grid whose size is given by the {\et PartitionSize}
variable.  Experimenting with this size can lead to improved speed,
depending on the layout density.  The default partition size is 100
microns.  For best performance, this can be increased for low density,
or reduced for high density, where ``density'' refers to the number of
trapezoids per area.

\subsubsection{Flat Mode Options}

None of the per-cell options apply in flat mode, though with the
exception of {\vt -e} if given they will be benignly ignored.  Flat
mode applies only to physical data, and if {\vt -e} is given, an error
will result.

In flat mode, both {\it source} tokens must be provided, as flat
comparison to memory cells is not available.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -a} {\it L,B,R,T}}\\
The {\vt -a} option specifies the rectangular area where comparison is
performed.  If not given, comparison is performed over the entire cell
area of both cells.  The word that follows {\vt -a} consists of the
four rectangle coordinate values, in microns, separated by commas. 
There can be no white space.
\end{description}

The flat geometry mode is somewhat orthogonal to the other modes.  The
algorithm uses two levels of gridding to partition the layout into
pieces, and directly compares the geometry in each fine grid cell. 
This is very similar to the algorithm described for the {\vt
ChdIterateOverRegion} script function.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt -i} {\it fine\_grid}}\\
This sets the size of the fine grid used for comparison.  The geometry
in each fine grid cell is compared.  The value is in microns in the
range 1.0 -- 100.0, if not given 20.0 is used.

\item{{\vt -m} {\it coarse\_mult}}\\
This sets the size of the coarse grid, as an integer multiple of the
fine grid size.  The coarse grid size is the chunk size for reading
geometry into memory.  Once in memory, the geometry is split into the
fine grid cells and compared.  Using too large of a coarse grid can
cause memory exhaustion for dense layouts, but on the other hand a
larger coarse grid size usually improves speed.  The user should
experiment to find the best values for the fine and coarse grid for
their layouts.  The acceptable range for this parameter is 1 -- 100. 
If not given, 20 is used.

``{\vt p}'', and ``{\vt w}''.  This indicates the type of objects to
test:  boxes, polygons, and wires.  If not given, ``{\vt bpw}'' is
assumed.

Note:  only the lower left and upper right vertices of boxes are
tested, since the other two are redundant.

\item{{\vt -d} {\it depth}}\\
This sets the maximum hierarchy depth to search for objects.  If not
given, all levels of the hierarchy will be searched.  A zero value
would search only the current cell.

\item{{\vt -f} {\it outfile}}\\
This sets the name of the output file, which will contain a sorted
list of off-grid vertices.  If not given, the name of the current
cell, suffixed with ``{\vt \_vertices.log}'', will be used.  If the

    <p>
    Wire database objects have the property that their geometric shape
    is not unambiguously specified.  Every tool contains code that
    generates a polygon from the wire vertex list, which can be
    displayed and further processed.  The details of how corners are
    handled, and how the "rounded" end style is handled, can vary
    slightly between tools.

    <p>
    Some wires are difficult to represent as a polygon, and in fact
    may cause failure with some tools (and possibly not others). 
    Although wires sensibly created by hand would rarely if ever cause
    trouble, wires generated by format converters or some other
    program might cause faiures, for example when "fracturing" the
    layout file during mask generation.  Even wires that look
    reasonable on-screen may not be renderable on other tools, thus
    <i>Xic</i> provides some tests that can be applied to flag
    potential problems.

    <p>
    Wires can be "questionable" or "bad".  Bad wires can not be
    rendered, and will never be included in the <i>Xic</i> database. 
    These wires are always flagged as errors when seen.

    <p>
    Wires that are "questionable" have vertices that are closely
    spaced compared to the wire width, and trigger an edge-clipping
    fixup in the wire-to-polygon function.  Such wires may cause
    rendering difficulty in other tools.  In addition, wires whose
    polygon representation requires more than 600 vertices are flagged
    as questionable.

    <p>
    When reading a layout file, questionable wires will be reported
    as warnings in the log file.

    <p>
    This command can be used to find questionable wires in the current
    cell.  It takes a list of layer names as arguments, which will
    limit the testing to wires on those layers.  If no arguments are
    given, all layers will be used.

    <p>
    If wires are selected before the command is given, only the
    selected wires on the given layers (or on any layer, if no
    arguments are given) will be checked.  If no wires are selected,
    all wires on the layers given (or on any layer if no arguments are
    given) will be checked.

    <p>
    If a wire is determined to be questionable, it will be, or remain,
    selected.  The <a href="xic:info"><b>Info</b></a> command in the
    <b>View Menu</b> can be used to determine the exact nature of the
    defect.

    <p>
    The flags that might be listed in the info for wires have the
    following explanations.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ONEVERT</tt><dd>
    The wire consists of a single vertex only.  The interpretation of
    this case may be tool-dependent.

    The wire contains at least two vertices whose spacing is less than
    half of the wire width.  This may not be a problem, however wires
    that are difficult to render will always have this condition.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>CLIPFIX</tt><dd>
    This flag indicates that special fixup code was triggered when the
    representing polygon was created, which indicates that rendering
    requires non-trivial processing.  Wires that have this flag are
    suspect (they will also always have <tt>CLOSEVERTS</tt> set).

Syntax: {\vt !mark l|b|t|u|c|e|d|w|r  [{\it attr\_flags\/}]}
\end{quote}
This command allows the user to add annotation marks to the cell
display, physical or electrical.  These marks are not part of the
design and will not be saved in output, but are useful for temporarily
marking or highlighting an area for reference.  They will appear on
plots of the cell.

The marks are persistent to a cell, meaning that they will appear
whenever the cell is displayed as the top-level cell in a window. 
Each cell in memory can have its own set of marks.  Marks are not
displayed in expanded subcells.

The first argument is a letter giving the initial type of mark to
create.  When the command is active, any of these letters may be typed
in a drawing window, which will change the current mark type.  While
the command is active, clicking twice or dragging will produce a mark,
and Shift-clicking in an existing mark will delete the mark.

The optional {\it attr\_flags} is a decimal number representing flags
bits that control presentation format of the mark.  The bits are

\begin{description}
\item{bit 0}\\
When set, a dashed line is used, otherwise solid.
\item{bit 1}\\
When set, the mark will blink.
\item{bit 2}\\
When set, an alternate color will be used for the mark (bit 1 is
ignored).  The default is the normal highlighting color.
\end{description}

The value is a digit representing the set bits, for example 3 sets bits 0
and 1, 5 sets bits 0 and 2, etc.  A value 0 is the default.

When the command is active, pressing a digit key will reset the current
attribute flags for subsequent marks.

The following marks are available:
\begin{description}
\item{\vt l}\\
Draw a line.  Click twice or drag to define the line endpoints.

\item{\vt b}\\
Draw an open box.  Click twice or drag to define the box boundary.

\item{\vt t}\\
Draw an open ``horizontal'' triangle, with the base a vertical line,
and the third point pointing to the left or right at the midpoint of
the base.  The triangle will fit inside of the ghost-drawn box shown
during creation.  The initial press location sets the x coordinate of
the triangle base.

\item{\vt u}\\
Draw an open ``vertical'' triangle, with the base a horizontal line,
and the third point pointing up or down at the midpoint of the base. 
The triangle will fit inside of the ghost-drawn box shown during
creation.  The initial press location sets the y coordinate of the
triangle base.

\item{\vt c}\\
Draw an open circle.  The press location is the center of the circle,
and the distance to the second point sets the radius.

\item{\vt e}\\
Draw an open ellipse.  The ellipse will fit inside of the ghost-drawn
box shown during creation.
\end{description}

To delete a mark, while the {\cb !mark} command is active, click on
the mark to delete with the {\kb Shift} key held.  Any mark under the
click location will be deleted, not just those of the current type.

Marks can be saved to a file, and restored from a file.  This is
accomplished by giving the following code letters, which can appear in
the same contexts as the mark code letters.

\begin{description}
\item{{\vt d} or {\vt w}}\\
The user will be prompted for the name of a file, then the
existing marks in the current cell will be written to the file.

\item{\vt r}\\
The user will be prompted for the name of a file, which should be in
the format produced with the {\vt d} or {\vt w} option.  If the file
was produced for the same cell name and display mode of the current
cell, the marks will be read from the file and added to the current
cell.
\end{description}

The file format is not currently documented, but is very simple and
should be easy to figure out by inspection.

The marks manipulated with the {\cb mark} command are the same as the
marks produced with the {\vt AddMark} script function.  Note that {\vt
AddMark} can create additional mark types not (yet) supported by the
command interface.

This command exists only when the OpenAccess plug-in is loaded.

This function has a number of forms, corresponding to various actions
to perform on the technology database.  These forms, and the
corresponding actions, are described below.  In each case, the first
character of the first token indicates the command type.  If this is
preceded by a hyphen, the hyphen will be ignored.  Thus, for example,
first arguments ``{\vt -p}'', ``{\vt p}'', and ``{\vt print}'' are all
equivalent.

\begin{description}
\item{[-]{\vt a}[{\vt ttach}] {\it libname} {\it fromlib}}\\
Attach the technology database from {\it fromlib} to {\it libname}. 
This will fail if {\it libname} has a local technology database, such
must be destroyed first.  If {\it fromlib} has an attachment, then
{\it libname} will receive the same attachment, otherwise {\it
libname} will attach to the local technology database in {\it
fromlib}.

\item{[-]{\vt d}[{\vt estroy}] {\it libname}}\\
If {\it libname} has an attached technology database, the attachment
will be removed.  Otherwise, the local technology database will be
destroyed.

\item{[-]{\vt h}[{\vt as\_attached}] {\it libname}}\\
This produces a message on the prompt line indicating whether or not
{\it libname} has an attached technology database, and if so, provides
the name of the library supplying the technology database.

\item{[-]{\vt p}[{\vt rint}] {\it libname} [{\vt -o} {\it filename\/}]
  [{\it which} [{\it prname\/}]]}\\
If {\it which} and {\it prname} are not given, a file in the format of
a Virtuoso ASCII technology file will be produced, containing all
technology information known to {\Xic} from the technology database
associated with {\it libname}. 

If {\it which} is given (including ``{\vt all}''), the file format is
not specific and a complete data dump of relevant data.  This is
intended for debugging and information searching.

Output goes to the console window by default, but the {\vt -o} option,
if given, signals that the following argument is a file name for
output.

The {\it which} is a code indicating what type of information to
print, and {\it prname} is a sub-type which applies to particular
values of {\it which}.  The prefixes understood for {\it which} are
listed below, characters that follow the prefix are ignored. 
Recognition is case-insensitive.

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\bf prefix & \bf prname & \bf will print\\

``{\vt g}''    & * & groups\\
\end{tabular}

For the types marked with an asterisk above, the {\it prname} is
recognized as the name associated with the records of that type, and
only the record with matching name, if any, will be printed.  If {\it

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!preload</tt> <i>archive</i></b>

    <p>
    Suppose that one has a collection of pcell sub-master <i>Xic</i>
    cells that have been imported from a foreign OpenAccess tool such
    as Virtuoso.  These are assumed to not be portable pcells.  One
    would like to use these cells to resolve pcells when reading
    directly from the OpenAccess database.  There are two issues:  1)
    the system needs to know that these cells are available, and 2)
    one has to remap the cell names.  The first issue is fixed simply
    by making the sub-masters available through the library mechanism. 
    The second issue is due to the simple naming convention of the
    sub-master instantiations, which suffixes the pcell name with
    "<tt>$$</tt>" followed by an integer.  The integer is a count of
    when the cell was generated, and is consistent with the design
    output at the time, but there is no guarantee the the names are
    consistent with the design at other times.

    <p>
    This command will read a collection of cells into a temporary
    symbol table.  Those that are pcell sub-masters have the property
    strings entered into the internal pcell database, under the
    existing cell name.  This will cause the correct cell name to be
    associated with a given parameter set.  The cells are not saved,
    but the entries in the pcell table persist so that resolution,
    when reading OpenAccess or otherwise, will reference the correct
    cells.  The cell collection must be available through an open
    library, and this function must be run before loading the design.

    <p>
    The argument is either a path to a directory containing native
    pcell sub-master cells, or a path to an archive file that contains
    the cells.  This capability is also available with the <a
    href="RegisterSubMasters"><tt>RegisterSubMasters</tt></a> script

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!select</tt> <i>what qualifier_or_regex</i>
        [<i>keyword expression</i>]</b>

    <p>
    This command allows objects to be selected according to the
    specification provided.  There is also a companion <a
    href="!desel"><b>!desel</b></a> command which deselects selected
    objects.

    <p>
    The values (literal) for <i>what</i> are:
    <blockquote><tt>
      c[ell]<br>
      l[ayer]<br>
      n[ame]<br>
      m[odel]<br>

      p[aram] or i[nitc]<br>
      o[ther]<br>
      y[...] (indicates <b>nophys</b>)
    </tt></blockquote>
    Only the first character of the token is significant.  If
    `<tt>c</tt>' is given, the intended targets for selection are
    subcells.  If `<tt>l</tt>' is given, the targets are objects on a
    specified layer.  The remaining options specify electrical
    properties, which allows selection of devices with these
    properties.  The <tt>param</tt> property was known in earlier
    releases as the <tt>initc</tt> (initial condition) property, both
    names are accepted.

    <p>
    The <i>qualifier_or_regex</i> is a pattern matching regular
    expression.  This is expected to match the layer or cell name or
    property value as per <i>what</i>.  All objects with a successful
    pattern match are selected.  The layer qualifier consists of the
    layer regular expression, followed by the optional tokens

    <blockquote><tt>
      b[oxes]<br>
      w[ires]<br>
      p[olygons]<br>
      l[abels]
    </tt></blockquote>
    These specify types of objects that will be selected.  For
    selecting objects on physical layers, an additional <i>keyword
    expression</i> pair can be included in the command.  The complete
    syntax in this case is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>!select l[ayer]</tt> <i>layer_re</i> <tt>[b[ox]] [w[ire]] [p[olygon]]
        [l[abel]] [</tt><i>keyword expression</i><tt>]</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    For layers, the hyphen ('<tt>-</tt>') is an alias for the current
    layer, but only as an isolated token and not as part of a layer
    expression.

    The <i>keyword</i> is one of the DRC keywords <tt>Overlap,
    IfOverlap, NoOverlap, AnyOverlap, PartOverlap,</tt> and
    <tt>AnyNoOverlap</tt>, and the <i>expression</i> is a layer
    expression.  If the <i>keyword</i> and <i>expression</i> are
    given, the <i>expression</i> must be true if an object is to be
    selected or deselected (with the !desel command).  The logic is
    shown in the table below.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><tt>Overlap</tt></td><td>
      True if the object is completely covered by the

    <tr><td><tt>IfOverlap</tt></td><td>
      True if the object is completely covered or completely uncovered
      by the <i>expression</i>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>NoOverlap</tt></td><td>
      True if the object is completely uncovered by the
      <i>expression</i>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AnyOverlap</tt></td><td>
      True if there is nonzero overlap area between the object and the
      <i>expression</i>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>PartOverlap</tt></td><td>
      True if the object is partially covered by the <i>expression</i>, i.e.,
      not completely covered or uncovered.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AnyNoOverlap</tt></td><td>
      True if the object is not completely covered by the
      <i>expression</i>.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Examples:

    <blockquote>
    <tt>!select l CAA b Overlap CPG</tt>
    </blockquote>

    This will select boxes on CAA that are entirely covered by CPG.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>!select l V1|V2 AnyNoOverlap M1 & M2</tt>
    </blockquote>

    This will select all geometric objects on V1 and V2 that are not
    completely covered by both M1 and M2.

    <p>
    The <b>!select</b>/<b>!desel</b> commands with electrical property
    specifiers also work in physical mode.  The selected cell will be
    the physical dual of the electrical cell containing the property. 
    The duality must have been established with the commands in the <a
    href="xic:extmenu"><b>Extract Menu</b></a>.

    <p>
    Examples:<br>
    Select all instances of the cell named "andgate"
    <blockquote><tt>
      !select c andgate
    </tt></blockquote>
    Select all instances of cells with name starting with "and".  The
    `.' is a wildcard.
    <blockquote><tt>
      !select c and.</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Select resistors R1-R9
    <blockquote><tt>
      !select n R[1-9]
    </tt></blockquote>
    Select all polygons and wires on layer M2
    <blockquote><tt>
      !select l M2 w p
    </tt></blockquote>
    Select everything on M2
    <blockquote><tt>
      !select l M2
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    A blank field is taken as "all".  Giving "<tt>!select</tt>"
    without arguments selects everything in the cell.  Giving
    "<tt>!select c</tt>" selects all subcells, etc.  For the layer
    modifier, the literal "<tt>all</tt>" can be used to specify all
    layers (hopefully there is no layer named "all").  For example,
    "<tt>!select l all b</tt>" selects boxes on all layers.  This is
    redundant, since "." performs the same global match as "all".

    <p>
    There are a couple of special cases:  "<tt>!select all</tt>" will
    select all geometry (not subcells) the same as "<tt>!select
    l</tt>", and "<tt>!select .</tt>" will select everything, the same
    as with no argument.

    <p>
    The regular expression matching may take some getting used-to. 
    A match will be indicated if the name contains a substring of
    the given string, case insensitive.  For example, "<tt>!select n
    Lc</tt>" would match <tt>Lc, Vlc, IallCnt</tt>, etc.  The
    circumflex ('^') can be used to force matching at the start of a
    string, and the dollar sign ('$') forces matching at the end of
    a string.  Thus, to match a literal, one should use the form
    "^<i>string</i>$".

\end{quote}
Only the first character of the token is significant.  If `{\vt c}'

remaining options specify electrical properties, which allows
selection of devices with these properties.  The {\vt param} property
was known in earlier releases as the {\vt initc} (initial condition)
property, both names are accepted.

The {\it qualifier\_or\_regex\/} is a pattern matching regular

These specify types of objects that will be selected.  For selecting
objects on physical layers, an additional {\it keyword expression}
pair can be included in the command.  The complete syntax in this case
is
\begin{quote}
    {\vt !select l[ayer] {\it layer\_re} [b[ox]] [w[ire]] [p[olygon]]
      [l[abel]] [{\it keyword expression\/}]}
\end{quote}
    
For layers, the hyphen (`{\vt -}') is an alias for the current layer,
but only as an isolated token and not as part of a layer expression.

The {\it keyword} is one of the DRC keywords {\et Overlap}, {\et
IfOverlap}, {\et NoOverlap}, {\et AnyOverlap}, {\et PartOverlap}, and
{\et AnyNoOverlap}, and the {\it expression} is a layer expression. 
If the {\it keyword} and {\it expression} are given, the {\it
expression} must be true if an object is to be selected or deselected
(with the {\cb !desel} command).  The logic is shown in the table
below.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt Overlap}\\
  True if the object is completely covered by the {\it expression\/}.
\item{\vt IfOverlap}\\
  True if the object is completely covered or completely uncovered
      by the {\it expression\/}.
\item{\vt NoOverlap}\\
  True if the object is completely uncovered by the {\it expression\/}.
\item{\vt AnyOverlap}\\
  True if there is nonzero overlap area between the object and the
  {\it expression\/}.
\item{\vt PartOverlap}\\
  True if the object is partially covered by the {\it expression\/}, i.e.,
  not completely covered or uncovered.
\item{\vt AnyNoOverlap}\\
  True if the object is not completely covered by the {\it expression\/}.
\end{description}
          
Examples:
\begin{quote}
    {\vt !select l CAA b Overlap CPG}
\end{quote}
This will select boxes on CAA that are entirely covered by CPG.

\begin{quote}
    {\vt !select l V1|V2 AnyNoOverlap M1 \& M2}
\end{quote}
This will select all geometric objects on V1 and V2 that are not
completely covered by both M1 and M2.

The {\cb !select}/{\cb !desel} commands with electrical property
modifiers also work in physical mode.  The selected cell will be the
physical dual of the electrical cell containing the property.  The
duality must have been established with the commands in the {\cb
Extract Menu}.

Examples:
\begin{quote}
Select all instances of the cell named ``andgate'':
\begin{quote}\vt
!select c andgate
\end{quote}
Select all instances of cells with name starting with ``and''.  The `.' is
a wildcard:
\begin{quote}\vt
!select c and.
\end{quote}
Select resistors R1-R9:
\begin{quote}\vt
!select n R[1-9]
\end{quote}
Select all polygons and wires on layer M2:
\begin{quote}\vt
!select l M2 w p
\end{quote}
Select everything on M2
\begin{quote}\vt
!select l M2
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

A blank field is taken as ``all''.  Entering {\vt !select} without
arguments selects everything in the cell.  Giving ``{\vt !select c}''
selects all subcells, etc.  For the layer modifier, the literal ``{\vt
all}'' can be used to specify all layers (hopefully there is no layer
named ``all'').  For example, ``{\vt !select l all b}'' selects boxes on
all layers.  This is redundant, since ``.'' performs the same global
match as ``all''.

There are a couple of special cases:  ``{\vt !select all}'' will
select all geometry (not subcells) the same as ``{\vt !select l}'',
and ``{\vt !select .}'' will select everything, the same as with no
argument.

The regular expression matching may take some getting used-to.  A
match will be indicated if the name contains a substring of the given
string, case insensitive.  For example, ``{\vt !select n Lc}'' would
match {\vt Lc, Vlc, IallCnt}, etc.  The circumflex (`\symbol{94}') can
be used to force matching at the start of a string, and the dollar
sign (`\$') forces matching at the end of a string.  Thus, to match a
literal, one should use the form ``\symbol{94}{\it string}\$''.

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!shell</tt> [<i>command...</i>]</b>

    <p>
    Giving the command "<tt>!shell</tt>" without arguments is
    equivalent to giving a bare exclamation point with no following
    text.  If a <i>command</i> is given, that command will be run in
    the pop-up window.  This is equivalent to <tt>!</tt><i>command</i>,
    provided that this is not also a built-in command.  The use of
    <tt>!shell</tt> removes the ambiguity.

    <p>
    The shell which is used to execute operating system commands can
    be selected by the user, through the <a
    href="!set:bangcmds#Shell"><b>Shell</b></a> variable and the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command.  If this is not set, the <a
    href="xic:env"><tt>SHELL</tt></a> environment variable is used if
    set, otherwise the default "<tt>/bin/sh</tt>" shell is used,
    except under Windows where the standard "DOS box" is the default.

    <p>
    Under Windows, it is possible to open a Cygwin <tt>bash</tt> shell
    window instead of the brain-dead "DOS box", if Cygwin is
    installed.  If the <b>Shell</b> variable or <tt>SHELL</tt>
    environment variable (in that precedence) contains the Windows
    path to the <tt>bash.exe</tt> file, a bash window will be used. 
    If neither is given, and <tt>bash.exe</tt> resides in
    <tt>/bin</tt> or <tt>/cygwin/bin</tt> on the current disk drive,
    or the <a href="CYGWIN_BIN"><tt>CYGWIN_BIN</tt></a> environment
    variable is set to the Windows path to the directory containing
    <tt>bash.exe</tt>, a bash shell will be used.  Only if
    <tt>bash.exe</tt> is not found, or one of the variables
    specifically invokes "<tt>cmd</tt>", will a DOS box be used.

Syntax: {\vt !shell} [{\it command...\/}]
\end{quote}
Giving the command ``{\cb !shell}'' without arguments is equivalent to
giving a bare exclamation point with no following text.  If a {\it
command} is given, that command will be run in the pop-up window. 
This is equivalent to {\vt !}{\it command}, provided that this is not
also a built-in command.  The use of {\vt !shell} removes the
ambiguity.

The shell which is used to execute operating system commands can be
selected by the user, through the {\et Shell} variable and the {\cb
!set} command.  If this is not set, the {\et SHELL} environment
variable is used if set, otherwise the default ``{\vt /bin/sh}'' shell
is used, except under Windows where the standard ``DOS box'' is the
default.

Under Windows, it is possible to open a Cygwin {\vt bash} shell window
instead of the brain-dead ``DOS box'', if Cygwin is installed.  If the
{\et Shell} variable or {\et SHELL} environment variable (in that
precedence) contains the Windows path to the {\vt bash.exe} file, a
bash window will be used.  If neither is given, and {\vt bash.exe}
resides in {\vt /bin} or {\vt /cygwin/bin} on the current disk drive,
or the {\vt CYGWIN\_BIN} environment variable is set to the Windows
path to the directory containing {\vt bash.exe}, a bash shell will be
used.  Only if {\vt bash.exe} is not found, or one of the variables
specifically invokes ``{\vt cmd}'', will a DOS box be used.

    <b>Syntax: <tt>!set</tt> <i>name</i> [<i>value</i>]</b>

    <p>
    The <b>!set</b> command is used to set variable <i>name</i> to
    <i>value</i>.  The <i>name</i> is the first token following
    <tt>!set</tt>, and <i>value</i> represents the rest of the line
    (which may be empty).  White space is stripped from the front of
    the first word in <i>value</i> and after the last word in
    <i>value</i>.  If <i>value</i> is blank, the variable is
    understood as a boolean, and is "set".

    <p>
    Any variable name can be set in this manner, though there are a
    number of <a href="!set:variables">variables</a> with predefined
    names which have significance to <i>Xic</i> operation. 
    Furthermore, device properties can be set with a variant of this
    command.  A variable which has been set can be removed with the <a
    href="!unset"><b>!unset</b></a> command.

    <p>
    In the <b>!set</b> command, tokens in the <i>value</i> string of
    the form $(<i>setvar</i>) are expanded to the string associated
    with <i>setvar</i>, if <i>setvar</i> has been set previously.
    This applies if <i>setvar</i> was set with the <b>!set</b> command
    or related script functions, or if <i>setvar</i> is set in the
    environment, i.e., is an <a href="xic:env">environment</a> variable.
    If <i>setvar</i> is not resolved, no change is made.  Otherwise,
    in general, the token is replaced with the value of <i>setvar</i>.

    <p>
    There is an exception to the direct-substitution rule.  If any
    substitution string is of the form "<tt>(...)</tt>", then the
    parentheses and leading/trailing white space are stripped before
    substitution, and the entire substituted string is enclosed in
    parentheses if it is not already.  This is for convenience when
    adding a directory to a <a href="xicpaths">search path</a>
    variable, and the path is enclosed in parentheses, when using
    forms like
    <blockquote>
    <tt>!set path</tt> <i>dir</i> <tt>$(path)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    In this case, the modified substitution rule ensures that <i>dir</i>
    is logically placed in front of the search path in <tt>path</tt>.
    For example, if <tt>path</tt> is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>( /dir1 /dir2 )</tt>

    then after the substitution implied above, one has
    <blockquote>

    this would give

White space is stripped from the front of the first word in

In the {\cb !set} command, tokens in the {\it value} string of the

replaced with the value of {\it setvar}.

There is an exception to the direct-substitution rule.  If any

a directory to a search path (see \ref{searchpaths}) variable, and the
path is enclosed in parentheses, when using forms like
\begin{quote}
\vt !set path {\it dir} \$(path)

example, if {\vt path} is

then after the substitution implied above, one has
\begin{quote}
\vt path = ( {\it dir} /dir1 /dir2 )
