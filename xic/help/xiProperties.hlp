Cell, Instance and Object Properties
!!HTML
    A property consists of an integer and a corresponding text string. 
    Every database object, including cells, instances, and geometrical
    objects, has the native ability to accept properties, though this
    is enabled selectively.  Properties are saved in the design data
    file along with the item to which it is attached.

    <p>
    The <a href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b><a>, which is
    brought up with the <b>Properties</b> button in the <b>Edit
    Menu</b>, provides the primary means of property manipulation of
    objects found in the current cell.  The <a
    href="xic:cprop"><b>Cell Property Editor</b></a>, which is
    obtained with the <b>Cell Properties</b> button in the same menu,
    provides the primary means for manipulating properties of the
    current cell itself.

    <p>
    Properties can be applied to physical objects and cells by the
    user, using the user's property number and format, to suit the
    user's purposes.  This is fine, as long as the user's property
    numbers are outside of the range reserved by <i>Xic</i>.  Other
    properties are set by <i>Xic</i> for internal use such as to store
    the grid used for the layout, or the GDSII end style for wires. 
    Still others may be set by the user, but have significance to
    <i>Xic</i>.  In schematic layouts, these properties define
    electrical parameters for devices, and are used when generating
    SPICE output.  In electrical mode, the user is restricted to a
    small set of properties understood by <i>Xic</i>, whereas in
    physical mode any non-restricted number and string are allowed. 
    Finally, <i>Xic</i> supports "pseudo-properties" which are not
    actual properties, i.e., they are not stored, but their
    application modifies or returns some parameter related to the
    object.  These are listed in the <b>Property Editor</b> when in
    physical mode.

Pseudo-Properties
!!HTML
    <i>Xic</i> supports "pseudo-properties" which when applied are not
    saved as properties, but rather change or return some parameter
    related to the object.  This allows the property setting mechanism
    to be used to alter the physical layout, which can be an important
    feature in design automation.

    <p>
    In physical mode, when the <a href="xic:prpty"><b>Property
    Editor</b><a/> is in use, the listing will include the available
    pseudo-properties for the current object.  The pseudo-properties
    can be "added" or "edited" to modify the current object (or all
    objects if in global mode).  As usual, such changes can be
    undone/redone with the standard operations.

    <p>
    Internally, pseudo-properties can be applied to any object,
    electrical or physical.  Many of the script functions that modify
    objects use the pseudo-property mechanism internally.  These
    functions can take electrical or physical input.  The graphical
    user interface, though, allows pseudo-properties to be applied in
    physical mode only, through the <b>Property Editor</b>.

    <p>
    The pseudo-properties are listed below, giving the property number
    and an internal name for the pseudo-property.

    <a name="XprpType"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7200: <tt>XprpType</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects.  The returned
     property string consists of a single character:  <tt>b</tt>,
     <tt>p</tt>, <tt>w</tt>, <tt>l</tt>, or <tt>c</tt> for boxes,
     polygons, wires, labels, or subcells respectively.  The returned
     value indicates the type of object.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpBB"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7201: <tt>XprpBB</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     boxes, polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is in
     the form <i>left</i>,<i>bottom</i> <i>right</i>,<i>top</i> where
     the <i>left</i>, etc. are the coordinates of the object's
     bounding box in internal units.  The x and y values are separated
     by commas.  When this property is applied to an object other than
     a subcell, the object's geometry is stretched to conform to the
     bounding box given.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpLayer"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7202: <tt>XprpLayer</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     boxes, polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is the
     name of the layer on which the object is defined.  For subcells,
     the returned name is "<tt>$$</tt>", which is the internal name
     for the layer on which subcells are defined.  When this property
     is given to an object (not a subcell), and if the name is found
     in the layer table, the object will be moved to the given layer.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpFlags"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7203: <tt>XprpFlags</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     all objects.  The property string is a list of values and
     keywords corresponding to special flags associated with the
     object.  These flags are set internally, and should not be set by
     the general user.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpState"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7204: <tt>XprpState</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     all objects.  The property string contains one of the keywords
     <tt>normal</tt>, <tt>selected</tt>, <tt>deleted</tt>,
     <tt>incomplete</tt>, and <tt>internal</tt>.  This indicates a
     state value for the object which is used internally.  These
     values should not be set by the general user.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpGroup"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7205: <tt>XprpGroup</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     all objects.  The property string is an integer corresponding to
     the conductor group assigned to the object by the extraction
     system.  Though all objects have this data field, it has
     relevance to objects other than labels that are defined on
     conducting layers only.  It is generally unwise for the user to
     set this value.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpCoords"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7206: <tt>XprpCoords</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     boxes, polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is a
     list of coordinates, one for each vertex, with the x and y values
     separated by a comma.  Line feeds are included in returned
     strings to keep the line length below 80 characters.  The values
     are in internal units.  For boxes, labels, and subcells, the
     coordinates are those of the bounding box.  For polygons and
     wires, the coordinates are the actual vertices.  For all but
     wires, the first and last coordinates are the same, i.e., the
     path is closed.  For boxes, polygons, wires, and labels, applying
     this property will change the object geometry.  When applied to
     boxes or polygons, If the new geometry is a Manhattan rectangle,
     the new figure will be a box, otherwise it will be a polygon. 
     When applied to wires, the new object will always be a wire, but
     with the new path.  The coordinates given to a label must
     describe a Manhattan rectangle, and the label will be stretched
     to fill the given rectangle, as with applying <tt>XprpBB</tt>. 
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpMagn"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7207: <tt>XprpMagn</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to
     all objects.  The return value is "1.000000" for objects other
     than cell instances, and the magnification value for cell
     instances.  When applied to an object or cell instance, the size
     of the object will change, and a "reference point" of the object
     will remain in a fixed location.

     <blockquote>
     <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
     <tr><th>object</th> <th>reference point</th></tr>
     <tr><td>box</td> <td>lower-left corner</td></tr>
     <tr><td>polygon</td> <td>first vertex in internal list</td></tr>
     <tr><td>wire</td> <td>first vertex in internal list</td></tr>
     <tr><td>label</td> <td>label reference point</td></tr>
     <tr><td>instance</td> <td>transformed master origin</td></tr>
     </table>
     </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpWwidth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7208: <tt>XprpWwidth</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from wires, and can be applied to
     wires.  The property string is the width of the wire in internal
     units.  When applied to a wire, the width will take the new
     value.  This has no effect when applied to objects other than
     wires.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpWstyle"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7209: <tt>XprpWstyle</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from and applied to wires.  When the
     property string is read, only the first character is significant,
     the rest if any are ignored.  This is used to set the end style
     of the wire to one of three possible states:  <b>flush</b>,
     <b>rounded</b>, or <b>extended</b>.  In <i>Xic</i>, both wire
     ends will have the same style.  If <b>flush</b>, the wire is
     truncated normal to the edges at the end vertices.  If
     <b>rounded</b>, the wire continues beyond the vertex by half the
     wire width, but is given a rounded (ideally semicircular) shape
     (this style is rarely used and is not recommended).  The
     <b>extended</b> style is similar in that the wire extends a
     half-width past the vertices, but the end is square.  This is the
     <i>Xic</i> default.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>leading character</th> <th>style</th></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>f</tt>,<tt>F</tt>, or <tt>0</tt> (zero)</td> <td>flush</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>r</tt>,<tt>R</tt>, or <tt>1</tt> (one)</td> <td>rounded</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>e</tt>,<tt>E</tt>, or <tt>2</tt></td> <td>extended</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
     Applying this property to a wire will cause that wire to be
     rendered with the given end style.  The property has no effect if
     given to objects other than wires.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpText"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7210: <tt>XprpText</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from labels, and can be applied to
     labels.  The return value is the text of the label.  The full
     text including encoded hypertext entries is provided.  When
     applied to a label, the label takes the new text.  There is no
     effect if this property is applied to objects other than labels.
    </dl>

    <a name="XprpXform"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>7211: <tt>XprpXform</tt>
    <dd>This value can be read from and applied to text labels.  It
    controls a set of flags associated with the label which define the
    presentation attributes.

    <p>
    The general syntax for the string value is
    <blockquote>
    [<tt>+</tt>|<tt>-</tt>] [<tt>0x</tt>]<i>hex</i>|<i>word</i>[,...]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Optionally, the string begins with a <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt>
    character.  If <tt>+</tt> appears, it indicates that the flag bits
    that are specified will be set, and those not specified will be
    unchanged.  If <tt>-</tt> is given, the flag bits specified will
    be unset, those not specified will be unchanged.  If neither, the
    flags will be set to a new value consisting of the bits specified
    which are set, other bits are not set.

    <p>
    The remaining part of the string effectively specifies a set of
    flag bits.  This consists of space or comma-separated keywords or
    hex integers.  Hex integers can have an optional "<tt>0x</tt>" or
    "<tt>0X</tt>" prefix.  The overall value is the OR of all terms
    given.  The table below lists the accepted keywords and the
    equivalent flag bits.  Keyword recognition is case-insensitive.

    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Word</th> <th>Hex Bits</th> <th>Description</th></tr>

    <p>
    The <tt>SHOW</tt>/<tt>HIDE</tt> bits are for implementing a
    clickable text display, where the label text can be shown or
    "hidden" by rendering a small glyph instead.  At most one of these
    bits should be set.  Either bit overrides the default which is in
    force when neither is set.  These can be applied to any label,
    however the "clickability" of the label is set by the <a
    href="LabelHiddenMode"><b>LabelHiddenMode</b></a> variable.  All
    labels are "clickable" by default, press <b>Shift</b> and click on
    the label to toggle the hidden/viewing status.

    <p>
    The <tt>TLEV</tt> bit gives the label the property of being
    invisible in instances of the containing cell, but visible when
    the cell is viewed as the top-level (current cell).

    <p>
    The <tt>LIML</tt> bit causes the label to limit the number of
    lines displayed, when the label text has multiple lines.  The
    maximum line count defaults to 5, and is otherwise given with the
    <a href="LabelMaxLines"><b>LabelMaxLines</b></a> variable.

!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    <p>
    The <tt>TLEV</tt> and <tt>LIML</tt> bits may be applied when
    reading schematic cells through OpenAccess for Virtuoso
    compatibility, but are not otherwise used in <i>Xic</i>, except as
    controlled through this pseudo-property.
!!ENDIF

    <p>
    When applied to a label, the label will be rendered using the new
    flags.  This property has no effect when applied to objects other
    than labels.

     <i>ny</i> are the number of columns and rows, and the <i>dx</i>
     and <i>dy</i> are the center to center spacings in internal

    The settable pseudo-properties for an object are listed in the
    <b>Property Editor</b>, along with the "real" properties.  These
    can be changed in the same way, which will produce physical
    changes to the object.
!!LATEX pseudoprops editmenu.tex
{\Xic} supports ``pseudo-properties'' which when applied are not saved
as properties, but rather change or return some parameter related to
the object.  This allows the property setting mechanism to be used to
alter the physical layout, which can be an important feature in design
automation.

In physical mode, when the {\cb Property Editor} is in use, the
listing will include the available pseudo-properties for the current
object.  The pseudo-properties can be ``added'' or ``edited'' to
modify the current object (or all objects if in global mode).  As
usual, such changes can be undone/redone with the standard operations. 

Internally, pseudo-properties can be applied to any object, electrical
or physical.  Many of the script functions that modify objects use the
pseudo-property mechanism internally.  These functions can take
electrical or physical input.  The graphical user interface, though,
allows pseudo-properties to be applied in physical mode only, through
the {\cb Property Editor}.

The pseudo-properties are listed below, giving the property number
and an internal name for the pseudo-property.

\begin{description}
\index{pseudo-properties!XprpType}
\index{XprpType pseudo-property}
\item{7200: {\et XprpType}}\\
This value can be read from all objects.  The returned property string
consists of a single character:  {\vt b}, {\vt p}, {\vt w}, {\vt l},
or {\vt c} for boxes, polygons, wires, labels, or subcells
respectively.  The returned value indicates the type of object.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpBB}
\index{XprpBB pseudo-property}
\item{7201: {\et XprpBB}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to boxes,
polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is in the form {\it
left\/},{\it bottom} {\it right\/},{\it top} where the {\it left\/},
etc.  are the coordinates of the object's bounding box in internal
units.  The {\et x} and {\et y} values are separated by commas.  When
this property is applied to an object other than a subcell, the
object's geometry is stretched to conform to the bounding box given.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpLayer}
\index{XprpLayer pseudo-property}
\item{7202: {\et XprpLayer}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to boxes,
polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is the name of the
layer on which the object is defined.  For subcells, the returned name
is ``{\vt \$\$}'', which is the internal name for the layer on which
subcells are defined.  When this property is given to an object (not a
subcell), and if the name is found in the layer table, the object will
be moved to the given layer.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpFlags}
\index{XprpFlags pseudo-property}
\item{7203: {\et XprpFlags}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to all
objects.  The property string is a list of values and keywords
corresponding to special flags associated with the object.  These
flags are set internally, and should not be set by the general user.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpState}
\index{XprpState pseudo-property}
\item{7204: {\et XprpState}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to all
objects.  The property string contains one of the keywords {\vt
normal}, {\vt selected}, {\vt deleted}, {\vt incomplete}, and {\vt
internal}.  This indicates a state value for the object which is used
internally.  These values should not be set by the general user.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpGroup}
\index{XprpGroup pseudo-property}
\item{7205: {\et XprpGroup}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to all
objects.  The property string is an integer corresponding to the
conductor group assigned to the object by the extraction system. 
Though all objects have this data field, it has relevance to objects
that are defined on conducting layers only.  It is generally unwise
for the user to set this value.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpCoords}
\index{XprpCoords pseudo-property}
\item{7206: {\et XprpCoords}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to boxes,
polygons, wires, and labels.  The property string is a list of
coordinates, one for each vertex, with the {\et x} and {\et y} values
separated by a comma.  Line feeds are included in returned strings to
keep the line length below 80 characters.  The values are in internal
units.  For boxes, labels, and subcells, the coordinates are those of
the bounding box.  For polygons and wires, the coordinates are the
actual vertices.  For all but wires, the first and last coordinates
are the same, i.e., the path is closed.  For boxes and polygons,
applying this property will change the object geometry.  If the new
geometry is a Manhattan rectangle, the new figure will be a box,
otherwise it will be a polygon.  When applied to wires, the new object
will always be a wire, but with the new path.  The coordinates given
to a label must describe a Manhattan rectangle, and the label will be
stretched to fill the given rectangle, as with applying {\et XprpBB}.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpMagn}
\index{XprpMagn pseudo-property}
\item{7207: {\et XprpMagn}}\\
This value can be read from all objects, and can be applied to all
objects.  The return value is ``1.000000'' for objects other than cell
instances, and the magnification value for cell instances.  When
applied to an object or cell instance, the size of the object will
change, and a ``reference point'' of the object will remain in a fixed
location.

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\bf object & \bf reference point\\
box & lower-left corner\\
polygon & first vertex in internal list\\
wire & first vertex in internal list\\
label & label reference point\\
instance & transformed master origin\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpWwidth}
\index{XprpWwidth pseudo-property}
\item{7208: {\et XprpWwidth}}\\
This value can be read from wires, and can be applied to wires.  The
property string is the width of the wire in internal units.  When
applied to a wire, the width will take the new value.  This has no
effect when applied to objects other than wires.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpWstyle}
\index{XprpWstyle pseudo-property}
\item{7209: {\et XprpWstyle}}\\
This value can be read from and applied to wires.  When the property
string is read, only the first character is significant, the rest if
any are ignored.  This is used to set the end style of the wire to one
of three possible states:  {\bf flush}, {\bf rounded}, or {\bf
extended}.  In {\Xic}, both wire ends will have the same style.  If
{\bf flush}, the wire is truncated normal to the edges at the end
vertices.  If {\bf rounded}, the wire continues beyond the vertex by
half the wire width, but is given a rounded (ideally semicircular)
shape (this style is rarely used and is not recommended).  The {\bf
extended} style is similar in that the wire extends a half-width past
the vertices, but the end is square.  This is the {\Xic} default.

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\bf leading character & \bf style\\
{\vt f},{\vt F}, or {\vt 0} (zero) & flush\\
{\vt r},{\vt R}, or {\vt 1} (one) & rounded\\
{\vt e},{\vt E}, or {\vt 2} & extended\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
 
Applying this property to a wire will cause that wire to be rendered
with the given end style.  The property has no effect if given to
objects other than wires.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpText}
\index{XprpText pseudo-property}
\item{7210: {\et XprpText}}\\
This value can be read from labels, and can be applied to labels.  The
return value is the text of the label.  The full text including
encoded hypertext entries is provided.  When applied to a label, the
label takes the new text.  There is no effect if this property is
applied to objects other than labels.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpXform}
\index{XprpXform pseudo-property}
\item{7211: {\et XprpXform}}\\
This value can be read from and applied to text labels.  It controls a
set of flags associated with the label which define the presentation
attributes.

The general syntax for the string value is
\begin{quote}
[{\vt +|-}] [{\vt 0x}]{\it hex\/}{\vt |}{\it word\/}[,...]
\end{quote}

Optionally, the string begins with a {\vt +} or {\vt -} character. 
If {\vt +} appears, it indicates that the flag bits that are specified
will be set, and those not specified will be unchanged.  If {\vt -}
is given, the flag bits specified will be unset, those not specified
will be unchanged.  If neither, the flags will be set to a new value
consisting of the bits specified which are set, other bits are not
set.

The remaining part of the string effectively specifies a set of flag
bits.  This consists of space or comma-separated keywords or hex
integers.  Hex integers can have an optional ``{\vt 0x}'' or ``{\vt
0X}'' prefix.  The overall value is the OR of all terms given.  The
table below lists the accepted keywords and the equivalent flag bits. 
Keyword recognition is case-insensitive.

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
\bf Word & \bf Hex Bits & \bf Description\\ \hline\hline
\vt R0 & 0 & no rotation (dummy token)\\ \hline
\vt R45 & 10 & 45 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R90 & 1 & 90 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R135 & 11 & 135 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R180 & 2 & 180 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R225 & 12 & 225 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R270 & 3 & 270 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt R315 & 13 & 315 degree rotation\\ \hline
\vt MY & 4 & mirror Y after rotation\\ \hline
\vt MX & 8 & mirror X after rotation and mirror Y\\ \hline
\vt HJL & 0 & left justify (dummy token)\\ \hline
\vt HJC & 20 & center X justify\\ \hline
\vt HJR & 40 & right justify\\ \hline
\vt VJB & 0 & bottom justify (dummy token)\\ \hline
\vt VJC & 80 & center Y justify\\ \hline
\vt VJT & 100 & top justify\\ \hline
\vt T0 & 0 & text font 0 (dummy)\\ \hline
\vt T1 & 200 & text font 1 (unused)\\ \hline
\vt T2 & 400 & text font 2 (unused)\\ \hline
\vt T3 & 600 & text font 3 (unused)\\ \hline
\vt SHOW & 1000 & show hidden label\\ \hline
\vt HIDE & 2000 & hide label\\ \hline
\vt TLEN & 4000 & show in top-level only\\ \hline
\vt LIML & 8000 & limit lines\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

The {\vt HJR} will override {\vt HJC} if both are given, similarly
{\vt VJT} will override {\vt VJC}.

The {\vt SHOW}/{\vt HIDE} bits are for implementing a clickable text
display, where the label text can be shown or ``hidden'' by rendering
a small glyph instead.  At most one of these bits should be set. 
Either bit overrides the default which is in force when neither is
set.  These can be applied to any label, however the ``clickability''
of the label is set by the {\et LabelHiddenMode} variable.  All labels
are ``clickable'' by default, press {\kb Shift} and click on the label
to toggle the hidden/viewing status.

The {\vt TLEV} bit gives the label the property of being invisible in
instances of the containing cell, but visible when the cell is viewed
as the top-level (current cell).

The {\vt LIML} bit causes the label to limit the number of lines
displayed, when the label text has multiple lines.  The maximum line
count defaults to 5, and is otherwise given with the {\et
LabelMaxLines} variable.

%\ifoa
The {\vt TLEV} and {\vt LIML} bits may be applied when reading
schematic cells through OpenAccess for Virtuoso compatibility, but are
not otherwise used in {\Xic}, except as controlled through this
pseudo-property.
%\fi

When applied to a label, the label will be rendered using the new flags. 
This property has no effect when applied to objects other than labels.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpArray}
\index{XprpArray pseudo-property}
\item{7212: {\et XprpArray}}\\
This value can be read from subcell instances, and can be applied to
subcell instances.  The property string is of the form ``{\it
nx\/},{\it ny} {\it dx\/},{\it dy}'' where {\it nx} and {\it ny} are
the number of columns and rows, and the {\it dx} and {\it dy} are the
center to center spacings in internal units, for an array of subcells. 
When applied to an instance, the array parameters of the instance are
correspondingly changed.  This property has no effect on objects other
than subcells.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpTransf}
\index{XprpTransf pseudo-property}
\item{7213: {\et XprpTransf}}\\
This value can be read from subcell instances, and can be applied to
subcell instances.  The property string is the CIF transformation
string for the instance, with coordinates in internal units.  When
applied to an instance, the instance placement and orientation change
to reflect the new transformation.  This property has no effect on
objects other than subcells.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpName}
\index{XprpName pseudo-property}
\item{7214: {\et XprpName}}\\
This value can be read from subcell instances, and can be applied to
subcell instances.  The property string is the name of the
instantiated cell.  If this property is set, the instance is replaced
by an instance of the given cell name.  The current transform is added
to the existing transform when the new instance is placed.  This
property has no effect on objects other than subcells.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpXY}
\index{XprpXY pseudo-property}
\item{7215: {\et XprpXY}}\\
This pseudo-property has a value that is an x,y coordinate, and can be
read from or applied to any object or subcell.  The interpretation of
this coordinate depends on the type of object.  For boxes, it is the
lower-left corner.  For polygons and wires, it is the first vertex in
the vertex list.  For labels, it is the text anchor point, and for
subcells it is the placement coordinate.  Setting the property is
equivalent to moving the object.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpWidth}
\index{XprpWidth pseudo-property}
\item{7216: {\et XprpWidth}}\\
This pseudo-property returns the width of any object or cell instance
in internal units.  It can be applied to objects but not cell
instances, and will scale the object to the specified width.

\index{pseudo-properties!XprpHeight}
\index{XprpHeight pseudo-property}
\item{7217: {\et XprpHeight}}\\
This pseudo-property returns the height of any object or cell instance
in internal units.  It can be applied to objects but not cell
instances, and will scale the object to the specified height.
\end{description}

The settable pseudo-properties for an object are listed in the {\cb
Property Editor}, along with the ``real'' properties.  These can be
changed in the same way, which will produce physical changes to the
object.

    This section lists the properties known to <i>Xic</i> that may be
    found in physical cells, instances, or objects.  This lists only
    properties likely to be encountered by the user, there may be
    additional properties that are not specifically documented used
    internally by <i>Xic</i>.  All physical properties known to
    <i>Xic</i> use numbers in the reserved range 7000 - 7199.

    <a name="text"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>text</b> property, number 7012<dd>
    This property saves GDSII label parameters ANGLE, MAG, WIDTH, and
    PTYPE, which are unused by <i>Xic</i>.  The string consists of a
    concatenation of keyword/value pairs, using the keywords above
    (not all need be present).  These attributes will be reassigned to
    the label when a GDSII file is written.
    </dl>

    <a name="pathtype"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>pathtype</b> property, number 7033<dd>
    This property is used for physical mode wires of nonzero width
    which have a non-default path type.  The string has the form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>PATHTYPE</tt> <i>pathtype</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <i>pathtype</i> is 0 for flush ends, 1 for rounded ends. 
    The default pathtype is 2 (extended ends).  This property is added
    to wires in native and CIF output if the <a
    href="CifOutExtensions"><b>CifOutExtensions</b></a> variable has
    the <b>wire extension</b> flag set, and the <b>wire extension
    new</b> flag is <b>not</b> set.  The wire end style is included in
    the <a href="symfilefmt#cifext">wire specification</a> in the
    present default syntax, so <b>wire extension new</b> is set by
    default.
    </dl>

    <a name="grid"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>grid</b> property, number 7100<dd>
    This property is applied to the top-level physical cell when the
    cell is saved, preserving the current grid setting.  This property
    is used in physical mode only.  The property string has the format
    <blockquote>
    <tt>grid</tt> <i>resol</i> <i>snap</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <i>resol</i> is the number of internal units per snap point,
    and <i>snap</i> is the number of snap points per grid line if
    positive, or grid lines per snap point if negative.
    </dl>

    <a name="flags"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>flags</b> property, number 7105<dd>
    This property can be be applied to physical cells.  The property
    string can take one of two forms:  a hex number, or a
    space-separated list of string tokens.  The tokens and
    corresponding bits are

!!LATEX physpropfmt properties.tex
This section lists the properties known to {\Xic} that may be found in
physical cells, instances, or objects.  This lists only properties
likely to be encountered by the user, there may be additional
properties that are not specifically documented used internally by
{\Xic}.  All physical properties known to {\Xic} use numbers in the
reserved range 7000 -- 7199.

\begin{description}
\index{properties!text}
\index{text property}
\item{\et text} property, number 7012\\
This property saves GDSII label parameters ANGLE, MAG, WIDTH, and
PTYPE, which are unused by {\Xic}.  The string consists of a
concatenation of keyword/value pairs, using the keywords above
(not all need be present).  These attributes will be reassigned to
the label when a GDSII file is written.

\index{pathtype property}
\index{properties!pathtype}
\item{\et pathtype} property, number 7033\\
This property is used for physical mode wires of nonzero width
which have a non-default path type.  The string has the form
\begin{quote}
{\vt PATHTYPE} {\it pathtype}
\end{quote}
where {\it pathtype} is 0 for flush ends, 1 for rounded ends.  The
default pathtype is 2 (extended ends).
This property is added to wires in native and CIF output if the {\et
CifOutExtensions} variable has the {\cb wire extension} flag set, and
the {\cb wire extension new} flag is {\bf not} set.  The wire end
style is included in the wire specification in the present default
syntax, so {\cb wire extension new} is set by default. 

\index{properties!grid}
\index{grid property}
\item{\et grid} property, number 7100\\
This property is applied to the top-level physical cell when the cell
is saved, preserving the current grid setting.  This property is used
in physical mode only.  The property string has the format
\begin{quote}
{\vt grid} {\it resol} {\it snap}
\end{quote}
where {\it resol} is the number of internal units per snap point, and
{\it snap} is the number of snap points per grid line if positive, or
grid lines per snap point if negative.

\index{properties!flags}
\index{flags property}
\item{\et flags} property, number 7105\\
This property can be be applied to physical cells.  The property
string can take one of two forms:  a hex number, or a space-separated
list of string tokens.  The tokens and corresponding bits are

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
\bf Bit & \bf Keyword & \bf Description\\ \hline\hline
  &            & When set, the cell is ``opaque'' with regard to\\
0 & \vt OPAQUE & extraction.  The cell will look like a black box\\

2 & \vt USER0 & User flags, not used by {\Xic}.  These flags
  may be\\ \cline{1-2}
3 & \vt USER1 & useful to the user.\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

When the {\et ExtractOpaque} variable is set, the {\vt OPAQUE} flag is
ignored.

\index{properties!refcell}
\index{refcell property}
\item{\et refcell} property, number 7150\\
A reference cell is an empty cell with a {\et refcell} property,
which references a cell hierarchy in another layout file.  Reference
cells can exist in memory or as a native cell file on disk.

The string for this property consists of space-separated {\it
keyword\/}{\vt =}{\it value} pairs.  The known keywords are as
follows:

\begin{description}
\item{\vt cellname}\\
The top-level cell to extract from the referenced hierarchy.
\item{\vt dbname}\\
The CHD name in memory.  This is never written to a file, it is only
used when the cell is in memory.
\item{\vt filename}\\
The full path to the referenced layout file.
\item{\vt bound}\\
The bounding box, may be used for area filtering, in the form
{\it L\/},{\it B\/},{\it R\/},{\it T\/} where the values are
floating-point in microns.
\item{\vt aflags}\\
Alias flags integer, these set name aliasing modes.
\item{\vt aprefix}\\
Cell name change prefix.
\item{\vt asuffix}\\
Cell name change suffix.
\end{description}

\index{properties!flatten}
\index{flatten property}
\item{\et flatten} property, number 7151\\
During extraction, simple cells that contain only geometry or perhaps
all or part of a device can be logically flattened (see \ref{exthier})
into their parent cells for extraction purposes.  If this property is
set in a cell, that cell will always be considered as part of its
containing cell by the extraction system.

This is identical to the effect of listing the cell name in the {\et
FlattenPrefix} variable.

The string for this property is ignored, but is set to ``{\vt
flatten}'' by convention.

\index{properties!nomerge}
\index{nomerge property}
\item{\et nomerge} property, number 7152\\
The {\et nomerge} property applies to physical boxes, polygons, and
wires, and is used by the extraction system.  If this property is
found on any object used to recognize a device body, that device will
never be merged with similar devices.  This is relevant when merging
is enabled for the device during extraction, and one wants to suppress
this in individual cases.  It prevents both parallel and series
merging.

\index{properties!stdvia}
\index{stdvia property}
\item{\et stdvia} property, number 7160\\
This property is given to standard via sub-masters and instances.
%\ifoa
The property is recognized by the OpenAccess plug-in providing
transparent conversion between OpenAccess and {\Xic} standard vias.
%\fi
The syntax is described in \ref{stdviaprp}.

\index{properties!termorder}
\index{termorder property}
\item{\et termorder} property, number 7168\\
This is set to a space-separated list of group names, and can be
applied to physical cells.  It will provide the cell connection
terminal names and ordering when electrical data are absent.  The
names must match net name labels (see \ref{netname}) placed in the
layout.  Names not found are silently ignored.

\index{properties!skipdrc}
\index{skipdrc property}
\item{\et skipdrc} property, number 7178\\
This property is applied in output to boxes, polygons, or wires which
have the {\cb skip DRC} flag set.  It is used to set the {\cb skip
DRC} flag in boxes, polygons, and wires as an input file is being
read.

\index{properties!labelsize}
\index{labelsize property}
\item{\et labelsize} property, number 7180\\
This property is added to labels when writing to GDSII, and saves the
label width, height and visibility status.  The string has the format
\begin{quote}
{\vt width} {\it width} {\vt height} {\it height} [{\vt show}|{\vt hide}]
 [{\vt tlev}] [{\vt liml}]
\end{quote}
where {\it width} and {\it height} are in internal units.

The keywords ``{\vt show}'' or ``{\vt hide}'' appended to the string
store the display state of the label, which can be visible or
``hidden'', toggled by clicking with button 1 with the {\kb hift} key
held.  The {\et LabelHiddenMode} variable controls the scope of this
feature.

The {\vt tlev} keyword gives the label the property of being invisible
in instances of the containing cell, but visible when the cell is
viewed as the top-level (current cell).

The {\vt liml} keyword causes the label to limit the number of lines
displayed, when the label text has multiple lines.  The maximum line
count defaults to 5, and is otherwise given with the {\vt
LabelMaxLines} variable.

The four flags are the same as those accessible with the {\et
XprpXform} pseudo-property.

    The properties described in this section provide user-specified
    information to device and subcircuit instances, and to device and
    cell definitions.  In many cases, the property applied to a device
    definition will supply a default for a similar property created in

    library file to assign a default value for the device.

    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 2</tt> <i>value</i>;
    </blockquote>
    The <i>value</i> is a string which may, for example, represent a
    floating point number specifying the component value, e.g., in
    ohms for a resistor.  In general, any string can appear, and it
    may include hypertext references.  A complex string would be
    necessary for a voltage source with functional dependence, for
    example.
    </dl>

    <a name="param"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>param</b> property, number 3<dd>
    The <b>param</b> property specifies the part of the device SPICE
    line which provides an initial condition and other data not
    included in a model or value string.  The property is normally
    applied to device and subcircuit instances with the <b>Property
    Editor</b>, or to cells with the <b>Cell Property Editor</b>. 
    When applied to cells or subcircuit instances, the property is
    used to provide parameter definitions for SPICE (see the
    description of the <a href=".subckt"><tt>.subckt</tt></a> line). 
    This can also appear in the device definition in the device
    library file to provide a default.  If given to a cell, instances
    of the cell will inherit the property, which can then be changed
    from within <i>Xic</i> on a per-instance basis.  For device
    instances, this property specifies any parameter, such as device
    area, which is provided in the device line after the model.  This
    manifestation was referred to as the initial condition
    (<b>initc</b>) property in previous documentation.

    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 3</tt> <i>string</i>;
    </blockquote>
    The <i>string</i> will be appended to the device line when a SPICE file
    is created.  It can contain initial condition data or other
    parameters significant to the device, which are syntactically
    expected to the right of the model or value.

    <p>
    The parameter definitions in a <b>param</b> property string have
    the form

    <blockquote>
    <i>name1</i><tt>=</tt><i>value1</i>
    <i>name2</i><tt>=</tt><i>value2</i> ...
    </blockquote>

    There may be white space around the '<tt>=</tt>' character.  The
    <i>name</i> tokens are parameter names, which are alphanumeric
    words starting with an alpha character.  The <i>value</i> token
    can not be empty, and must be a single text token.  This means
    that if the <i>value</i> string contains white space, it must be
    single or double quoted.  Be aware that the interpretation of
    single quoted ('<tt>word</tt>') and double quoted
    ("<tt>word</tt>") differs fundamentally.  Double quoting implies a
    manifest string type.  The string will be assigned verbatim to the
    parameter, which will be of string type.  No further processing
    will be done.  Single quoting implies an expression which reduces
    to a number when evaluated.  If a <b>value</b> is not quoted, it
    will be evaluated as an expression if necessary, otherwise it will
    be taken as a numeric value.  Generally, parameter assignment
    failures are silently ignored.
    </dl>
  
    <a name="other"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>other</b> property, number 4<dd>
    The <b>other</b> property is a catch-all device property that is
    not used by <i>Xic</i> and does not appear in SPICE output.  There
    can be arbitrarily many <b>other</b> properties specified for a
    device, unlike the <b>model</b>, <b>value</b>, and
    <b>param</b> properties which can appear at most once.  The
    <b>other</b> property can be used for storage of alternate values
    for the <b>model</b>, <b>value</b>, and <b>param</b> properties. 
    It is applied to device instances with the <b>Property Editor</b>. 
    Although it can be used in device definitions in the device
    library file, there seems to be no reason for doing so. 

    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 4</tt> <i>string</i>;
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <a name="nophys"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>nophys</b> property, number 5<dd>
    When the <b>nophys</b> property is applied to an electrical device
    or subcircuit, that device or subcircuit is assumed to have no
    physical implementation and is ignored in the algorithm that
    associates electrical and physical devices and subcircuits.  A
    device or subcircuit with this property has no dual in the
    physical layout, and its terminals will never be placed in the
    physical layout, where they would otherwise be visible with the
    <b>Show Terms</b> command.  Devices and subcircuits with this
    property will be ignored in <a href="xic:lvs">LVS</a> testing.

    <p>
    In order to actually simulate a circuit that has been extracted
    from the physical layout, it is necessary to add sources and
    perhaps other devices, which have no counterparts in the physical
    layout.  In general, this will cause LVS errors in subsequent LVS
    runs.  The <b>nophys</b> property can be added to the additional
    devices to avoid these errors.

    <p>
    By "ignoring" these devices, the device terminals are considered
    as open circuits.  However, there are times when it would be
    useful to consider these devices as shorted.  For example, suppose
    that one wishes to include parasitic series inductance in a
    resistor during simulation.  However, this inductance would cause
    LVS to fail, since the series inductor added to the schematic has
    no explicit physical counterpart.

    <p>
    It is possible to configure the <b>nophys</b> property to indicate
    that when the electrical netlist is generated for use by the
    extraction system, the corresponding devices will be forced such
    that all terminals connect to the same net, i.e., the terminals
    are effectively shorted together.  Thus, the inductor in the
    example above, if given this property, would disappear properly
    during LVS.

    <p>
    The numerical value of the property is 5.  The property string is
    either "<tt>nophys</tt>" or "<tt>shorted</tt>".  The latter
    indicates that the shorting feature is to be used.  <i>Xic</i>
    will always set the property string to one of these values. 
    Devices inherit this property from cell definitions in the device
    library file.  The format is
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 5 nophys</tt>; or<br>
      <tt>5 5 shorted;</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Devices with the <b>nophys</b> property applied will be rendered
    using a different color than other devices.
    </dl>

    <a name="virtual"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>virtual</b> property, number 6<dd>
    When the <b>virtual</b> property is applied to an electrical
    subcircuit, the subcircuit will not be included in netlist output. 
    This means that in SPICE output, the corresponding
    "<tt>.subckt</tt>" block of lines will be absent.  However, calls
    to this subcircuit, if any, will be included, and must be resolved
    through text from a <tt>.include</tt> line or by some other means.

    <p>
    This is a method for including "foreign" subcircuits within the
    <i>Xic</i>/<i>WRspice</i> framework.

    <p>
    The numerical value of the property is 6.  The property string is
    "<tt>virtual</tt>".  <i>Xic</i> will always set the property
    string to this value.  This property applies only to electrical
    cell definitions (subcircuits).  The format is
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 6 virtual</tt>;
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <a name="flatten"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>flatten</b> property, number 7<dd>
    This can be applied to electrical masters and instances.  The
    state is active if the instance has the property and the master
    does not, or the instance does not have the property and the
    master does.  If active, the schematic will be logically flattened
    into its parent before association in <a href="xic:lvs">LVS</a>.
    </dl>

    <a name="range"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>range</b> property, number 8<dd>
    The <b>range</b> property can be applied to device (other than
    terminal devices) and subcircuit instances.  The property contains
    two non-negative integers, which define a range of values between
    the start and end integers inclusive, stepping by one.  When
    applied to an instance, the instance becomes <i>vectorized</i>,
    with the range providing the subscripts for the individual scalar
    instances.  Scalar contact terminals become vectors, and vectors
    become bundles.  Use of vector instances can simplify some
    schematics with repeated circuit blocks.  More information about
    vector instances and the rules for connecting to them can be found
    <a href="elec:vecinst">here</a>.

    <p>
    The property number is 8, and the property string consists of two
    non-negative integers, the starting and ending values of the
    subscripting range.  The property applies only to non-terminal
    device instances and subcell instances.
    </dl>

    <a name="macro"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>macro</b> property, number 20<dd>
    The <b>macro</b> property is <b>no longer in use</b>, having been
    replaced by the <tt>macro</tt> flag which is associated with the
    <a href="prpty:name"><b>name</b></a> property.  However, it is
    still recognized and performs its intended function when
    encountered.  By default, it will not be generated in output, thus
    there is a potential compatibility issue with <i>Xic</i> release
    4.3.5 and earlier.  The new variable <a
    href="WriteMacroProps"><b>WriteMacroProps</b></a> can be set
    before generating output to include <b>macro</b> properties, thus
    providing backwards compatibility.

    <p>
    While reading input, if a <b>macro</b> property is read, a window
    appears reminding the user to set <b>WriteMacroProps</b> if
    backwards compatibility is needed.  The message can be avoided by
    either of the following:
    <ol>
    <li>Save the design to a new file, it will not be backwards
    compatible, and will have no <b>macro</b> properties.

    <li>Set the <b>WriteMacroProps</b> variable in a startup script. 
    This suppresses the message, and backwards-compatible files will
    be produced.
    </ol>

    <p>
    It is no longer possible to (conveniently) create <b>macro</b>
    properties in <i>Xic</i>, for example with the <a
    href="xic:cprop"><b>Cell Property Editor</b></a>.

    <p>
    The <tt>macro</tt> flag (or property) applies to device master
    cells.  When present, its only effect is that in SPICE output, an
    '<tt>X</tt>' is prepended to the device name in instantiation
    lines of the device.  Thus, SPICE will treat the device instance
    as a subcircuit call.  These instances must have a <a
    href="prpty:model"><b>model</b></a> property giving a name that
    will match a <tt>.subckt</tt> definition somewhere, likely from a
    PDK device model file.

    <p>
    This accounts for devices that are likely the electrical part of
    parameterized cells, that implement nonlinear behavior through
    a network of controlled sources expressed as a subcircuit in the
    SPICE model definitions file.  MOS capacitors and poly resistors
    are devices that are frequently modeled this way.

    <p>
    If the <tt>macro</tt> flag is set and the name <i>prefix</i> already
    begins with <tt>X</tt> or <tt>x</tt>, the device is taken as a
    macro, meaning that <i>Xic</i> will not output a subcircuit
    definition for the cell, and a <b>model</b> property will provide the
    name of a subcircuit definition expected to be found in the model
    library or elsewhere.
    </dl>
  
    <a name="devref"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>devref</b> property, number 21<dd>
    This property maps text that appears in a SPICE device call after
    the node list but ahead of the model or value.  The purpose is to
    provide the name of a reference device for current-controlled
    sources (<a href="dev:cccs">CCCS</a> and <a
    href="dev:ccvs">CCVS</a>), and the current-controlled switch (<a
    href="dev:csw">CSW</a>).  This property can be applied to device
    instances only, and is supplied by the user typically with the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a>.

    <p>
    The property supports <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a>, and the
    reference name should be added as a hypertext reference, so that
    the correct device is referenced if the name should change.  That
    is, when editing the property string on the prompt line, click on
    the device to reference.  The device name will be entered in the
    line using colored text, indicating a hypertext entry.  Unlike
    plain test, the hypertext entry will still be correct if the
    referenced device name changes.

    <p>
    There is no default, and a missing property will produce a syntax
    error in a generated SPICE file.
!!LATEX elecpropuser properties.tex
The properties described in this section provide user-specified
information to device and subcircuit instances, and to device and cell
definitions.  In many cases, the property applied to a device
definition will supply a default for a similar property created in the
new instance when the device is instantiated.  The instance property
can be subsequently modified by the user. 

The {\et name} property described in the next section, plus the {\et
devref}, {\et model}, {\et value} and {\et param} properties discussed
below, translate into fields of device definition lines when
generating SPICE output, and in order to set these properties
proficiently, the user must have familiarity with the SPICE syntax.

The strings for these properties may contain special escape sequences
indicating hypertext references or other characteristics.  These are
described in \ref{prpescapes}.

\begin{description}
\index{properties!model}
\index{model property}
\item{\et model} property, number 1\\
The {\et model} property appears in device instances and defines a
device model to be included in the SPICE line for the device.  This
property is normally assigned to the device instance with the {\cb
Property Editor} from the {\cb Edit Menu}, but a default model can be
supplied by including this property in the device definition in the
device library file.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 1 {\it model\_name\/};
\end{quote}
The {\it model\_name\/} is arbitrary, but a corresponding entry should
exist in a model library file.

\index{value property}
\index{properties!value}
\item{\et value} property, number 2\\
The {\et value} property supplies a string to be used in the device
line in SPICE output for the device ``value''.  The property is
normally applied to device instances with the {\cb Property Editor},
but can appear in the device definition in the device library file to
assign a default value for the device.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 2 {\it value\/};
\end{quote}
The {\it value\/} is a string which may, for example, represent a
floating point number specifying the component value, e.g., in ohms
for a resistor.  In general, any string can appear, and it may include
hypertext references.  A complex string would be necessary for a
voltage source with functional dependence, for example.

\index{initc property}
\index{param property}
\index{properties!param}
\item{\et param} property, number 3\\
The {\et param} property specifies the part of the device SPICE line
which provides an initial condition or other data not included in a
model or value string.  The property is normally applied to device and
subcircuit instances with the {\cb Property Editor}, or to cells with
the {\cb Cell Property Editor} command.  When applied to cells or
subcircuit instances, the property is used to provide parameter
definitions for SPICE (see the description of the {\vt .subckt} line
in the {\WRspice} manual).  This can also appear in the device
definition in the device library file to provide a default.  If given
to a cell, instances of the cell will inherit the property, which can
then be changed from within {\Xic} on a per-instance basis.  For
device instances, this property specifies any parameter, such as
device area, which is provided in the device line after the model. 
This manifestation was referred to as the initial condition (``{\et
initc}'') property in previous documentation.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 3 {\it string\/};
\end{quote}
The {\it string\/} will be appended to the device line when a SPICE file
is created.  It can contain initial condition data or other parameters
significant to the device, which are syntactically expected to the
right of the model or value.

The parameter definitions in a {\et param} property string have the
form
\begin{quote}
{\it name1\/}{\vt =}{\it value1} {\it name2\/}{\vt =}{\it value2} ...
\end{quote}

There may be white space around the `{\vt =}' character.  The {\it
name} tokens are parameter names, which are alphanumeric words
starting with an alpha character.  The {\it value} token can not be
empty, and must be a single text token.  This means that if the {\it
value} string contains white space, it must be single or double
quoted.  Be aware that the interpretation of single quoted ({\vt
'word'}) and double quoted ({\vt "word"}) differs fundamentally. 
Double quoting implies a manifest string type.  The string will be
assigned verbatim to the parameter, which will be of string type.  No
further processing will be done.  Single quoting implies an expression
which reduces to a number when evaluated.  If a {\it value} is not
quoted, it will be evaluated as an expression if necessary, otherwise
it will be taken as a numeric value.  Generally, parameter assignment
failures are silently ignored.

\index{other property}
\index{properties!other}
\item{\et other} property, number 4\\
The {\et other} property is a catch-all device property that is not
used by {\Xic} and does not appear in SPICE output.  There can be
arbitrarily many {\et other} properties specified for a device, unlike
the {\et model}, {\et value}, and {\et param} properties which can
appear at most once.  The {\et other} property can be used for storage
of alternate values for the {\et model}, {\et value}, and {\et param}
properties.  It is applied to device instances with the {\cb Property
Editor}.  Although it can be used in device definitions in the device
library file, there seems to be no reason for doing so.
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 4 {\it string\/};}
\end{quote}

\index{nophys property}
\index{properties!nophys}
\item{\et nophys} property, number 5\\
When the {\et nophys} property is applied to an electrical device or
subcircuit, that device or subcircuit is assumed to have no physical
implementation and is ignored in the algorithm that associates
electrical and physical devices and subcircuits.  A device or
subcircuit with this property has no dual in the physical layout, and
its terminals will never be placed in the physical layout, where they
would otherwise be visible with the {\cb Show Terms} command.  Devices
and subcircuits with this property will be ignored in LVS testing.

In order to actually simulate a circuit that has been extracted from
the physical layout, it is necessary to add sources and perhaps other
devices, which have no counterparts in the physical layout.  In
general, this will cause LVS errors in subsequent LVS runs.  The {\et
nophys} property can be added to the additional devices to avoid these
errors.

By ``ignoring'' these devices, the device terminals are considered as
open circuits.  However, there are times when it would be useful to
consider these devices as shorted.  For example, suppose that one
wishes to include parasitic series inductance in a resistor during
simulation.  However, this inductance would cause LVS to fail, since
the series inductor added to the schematic has no explicit physical
counterpart.

It is possible to configure the {\et nophys} property to indicate that
when the electrical netlist is generated for use by the extraction
system, the corresponding devices will be forced such that all
terminals connect to the same net, i.e., the terminals are effectively
shorted together.  Thus, the inductor in the example above, if given
this property, would disappear properly during LVS.

The numerical value of the property is 5.  The property string is
either ``{\vt nophys}'' or ``{\vt shorted}''.  The latter indicates
that the shorting feature is to be used.  {\Xic} will always set the
property string to one of these values.  Devices inherit this property
from cell definitions in the device library file.  The format is
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 5 nophys;} or\\
{\vt 5 5 shorted;}
\end{quote}

Devices with the {\et nophys} property applied will be rendered using
a different color than other devices.

\index{virtual property}
\index{properties!virtual}
\item{\vt virtual} property, number 6\\
When the {\et virtual} property is applied to an electrical
subcircuit, the subcircuit will not be included in netlist output. 
This means that in SPICE output, the corresponding ``{\vt .subckt}''
block of lines will be absent.  However, calls to this subcircuit, if
any, will be included, and must be resolved through text from a {\vt
.include} line or by some other means.

This is a method for including ``foreign'' subcircuits within the
{\Xic}/{\WRspice} framework.

The numerical value of the property is 6.  The property string is
``{\vt virtual}''.  {\Xic} will always set the property string to this
value.  This property applies only to electrical cell definitions
(subcircuits).  The format is
\begin{quote}
\vt 5 5 virtual;
\end{quote}

\index{flatten property}
\index{properties!flatten}
\item{\vt flatten} property, number 7\\
This can be applied to electrical masters and instances.  The state is
active if the instance has the property and the master does not, or
the instance does not have the property and the master does.  If
active, the schematic will be logically flattened into its parent
before association in LVS.

\index{range property}
\index{properties!range}
\item{\vt range} property, number 8\\
The {\et range} property can be applied to device (other than terminal
devices) and subcircuit instances.  The property contains two
non-negative integers, which define a range of values between the
start and end integers inclusive, stepping by one.  When applied to an
instance, the instance becomes {\it vectorized}, with the range
providing the subscripts for the individual scalar instances.  Scalar
contact terminals become vectors, and vectors become bundles.  Use of
vector instances can simplify some schematics with repeated circuit
blocks.  More information about vector instances and the rules for
connecting to them can be found in \ref{vecinst}.

The property number is 8, and the property string consists of two
non-negative integers, the starting and ending values of the
subscripting range.  The property applies only to non-terminal device
instances and subcell instances.

\index{macro property}
\index{properties!macro}
\item{\vt macro} property, number 20\\
The {\et macro} property is {\bf no longer in use}, having been
replaced by the {\vt macro} flag which is associated with the {\et
name} property.  However, it is still recognized and performs its
intended function when encountered.  By default, it will not be
generated in output, thus there is a potential compatibility issue
with {\Xic} release 4.3.5 and earlier.  The new variable {\et
WriteMacroProps} can be set before generating output to include {\et
macro} properties, thus providing backwards compatibility.

While reading input, if a {\et macro} property is read, a window
appears reminding the user to set {\et WriteMacroProps} if backwards
compatibility is needed.  The message can be avoided by either of the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Save the design to a new file, it will not be backwards
compatible, and will have no {\et macro} properties.}

\item{Set the {\et WriteMacroProps} variable in a startup script. 
This suppresses the message, and backwards-compatible files will be
produced.}
\end{enumerate}

It is no longer possible to (conveniently) create {\et macro}
properties in {\Xic}, for example with the {\cb Cell Property Editor}.

The {\vt macro} flag (or property) applies to device master cells. 
When present, its only effect is that in SPICE output, an `{\vt X}' is
prepended to the device name in instantiation lines of the device. 
Thus, SPICE will treat the device instance as a subcircuit call. 
These instances must have a {\et model} property giving a name that
will match a {\vt .subckt} definition somewhere, likely from a PDK
device model file.

This accounts for devices that are likely the electrical part of
parameterized cells, that implement nonlinear behavior through a
network of controlled sources expressed as a subcircuit in the SPICE
model definitions file.  MOS capacitors and poly resistors are devices
that are frequently modeled this way.

If the {\vt macro} flag is set and the name {\it prefix} already
begins with {\vt X} or {\vt x}, the device is taken as a macro,
meaning that {\Xic} will not output a subcircuit definition for the
cell, and a {\et model} property will provide the name of a subcircuit
definition expected to be found in the model library or elsewhere.

\index{devref property}
\index{properties!devref}
\item{\vt devref} property, number 21\\
This property maps text that appears in a SPICE device call after the
node list but ahead of the model or value.  The purpose is to provide
the name of a reference device for current-controlled sources (CCCS
and CCVS), and the current-controlled switch (CSW).  This property
can be applied to device instances only, and is supplied by the user
typically with the {\cb Property Editor}.

The property supports hypertext, and the reference name should be
added as a hypertext reference, so that the correct device is
referenced if the name should change.  That is, when editing the
property string on the prompt line, click on the device to reference. 
The device name will be entered in the line using colored text,
indicating a hypertext entry.  Unlike plain test, the hypertext entry
will still be correct if the referenced device name changes.
  
There is no default, and a missing property will produce a syntax
error in a generated SPICE file.

    The properties that are set by <i>Xic</i> in electrical mode are

    The <b>bnode</b> property identifies the location of a "bus

    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>index</i> is a non-negative integer index which serves to
    link the bus node to an existing node with the same index.  The
    <i>beg_range</i> and <i>end_range</i> are non-negative integers
    which set the indexing of the bus.  The bus bit indices range from
    <i>beg_range</i> through <i>end_range</i>.  Note that the numbers
    can be ascending or descending.  The "bit" for <i>beg_range</i> is
    connected to the node with the given <i>index</i>.  The "bit" for
    <i>end_range</i> is connected to the node with index equal to
    <i>index</i> + <tt>abs(</tt><i>beg_range</i> -
    <i>end_range</i><tt>)</tt>.  If no node property has an equal
    index value, then that "bit" is simply open.

    <p>
    For cells, the <i>elecX</i> and <i>elecY</i> each have the general
    form
    <blockquote>
    <i>schemX</i>[<tt>:</tt><i>symbX</i>[<tt>,</tt><i>symbX</i> ...]]
    </blockquote>
    and similar for the Y values.  This represents a single X,Y
    contact location in the schematic, and an arbitrary number of
    contact locations in the <a href="xic:symbl">schematic symbol</a>. 
    The schematic value is separated from the symbolic values by a
    colon.  The symbolic values are separated from each other by
    commas.  If the 3.2 format is being written due to the <a
    href="Out32nodes"><b>Out32nodes</b></a> variable being set, at
    most one number will appear following the colon, the first that
    would otherwise be listed if there are multiple contact points.

    <p>
    If there is no symbolic representation, or the terminal location
    has not been set in the symbolic view, the <i>elecX</i> and
    <i>elecY</i> each consist of a single number.  In the more
    general case, both terms should supply the same number of
    integers.

    <p>
    In cell instances, there is no colon delimiter, and the general
    form is simply a comma-separated list of numbers.  This is all
    identical to the coordinate specification for a <b>node</b>
    property.
    </dl>

    <a name="node"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>node</b> property, number 10<dd>
    The <b>node</b> property defines a circuit connection point.  It
    appears as a property of wires, device and subcircuit instances,
    and cells.  Its string is a bit different in the three cases.

    <dl>
    <dt>Wire property<dd>
      <tt>5 10</tt> <i>circuit_node</i>
    </dl>

    <p>
    Any text that follows the form shown above is ignored.  The
    <i>circuit_node</i> is the node number in the current cell of the
    net containing the wire.  All wires that participate in
    connectivity, i.e., on the <tt>SCED</tt> layer and any layer with
    the <a href="WireActive"><tt>WireActive</tt></a> technology file
    keyword applied, should have a <b>node</b> property.

    <dl>
    <dt>Instance property<dd>
      <tt>5 10</tt> <i>circuit_node</i> <i>index</i> <i>elecX</i> <i>elecY</i>
        [<i>name</i>]
    </dl>

    <p>
    A subcircuit or device instance will have one <b>node</b> property
    per circuit connection.  The <i>circuit_node</i> is the node
    number of the connection in the current cell.  The <i>index</i> is
    the terminal ordering parameter.  Each <b>node</b> property of an
    instance will have a unique <i>index</i>.  The indices form a
    compact run starting with 0.

    <p>
    The <i>elecX</i> and <i>elecY</i>, are integers, or
    comma-separated lists of integers.  Both terms specify the same
    number of integers.  Taken as ordered X,Y values, these provide
    the "hot spots" where connection to the terminal can be made. 
    <i>Xic</i> allows an arbitrary number of hot spots per node.  If
    the <a href="Out32nodes"><b>Out32nodes</b></a> variable is set,
    which forces output compatible with earlier <i>Xic</i> releases,
    the <i>elecX</i> and <i>elecY</i> will each consist of a single
    value, the first in the list that would otherwise be output if
    there are multiple contact points.

    <p>
    Internally, there are 1000 integer counts per "micron", and hot
    spots must appear on a 1 "micron" (1000 unit) grid.  In a cell
    file, scaling may be applied.  In particular, the default for CIF
    and native cell files is 100 units per micron, but this is usually
    changed to 1000 units with the <tt>RESOLUTION 1000</tt> directive. 
    Anyway, if a user is for some reason writing a node property
    string by hand, the hot spot locations must be chosen
    appropriately, arbitrary locations do not work.

    <p>
    Anything that follows is actually ignored by the reader.  The
    terminal's name is printed in output since it might be of interest
    to humans.

    <p>
    The <b>node</b> properties applied to a cell make it possible for
    the cell to be instantiated and used as a subcircuit (or device)
    in another cell.

    <p>
    The property string parser can recognize and read the old release
    3.2 string format for compatibility.  When writing output in any
    file format, if the variable <a
    href="Out32nodes"><b>Out32nodes</b></a> is set, the old string
    format will be generated.  This will, however, strip out multiple
    contact points if any have been defined, as this is not supported
    by the older format, which allows exactly one contact per node. 
    The variable tracks the <b>Use back-compatible format (warning! 
    data loss)</b> check box in the <a href="xic:exprt"><b>Export
    Control</b></a> panel from the <b>Export Cell Data</b> button
    in the <b>Convert Menu</b>.

    <p>
    The <i>circuit_node</i> is the node number in the current cell
    where contact is to be made.  In a device cell that has no
    internal nodes, this will be -1.  The <i>index</i> is an ordering
    parameter as discussed above.  Index zero is the reference node. 
    When the device or subcircuit is placed in a schematic, the
    location of the reference node corresponds to where the user
    clicks.

    <p>
    The <i>elecX</i> and <i>elecY</i> each have the general form
    <blockquote>
    <i>schemX</i>[<tt>:</tt><i>symbX</i>[<tt>,</tt><i>symbX</i> ...]]
    </blockquote>
    and similar for the Y values.  This represents a single X,Y
    contact location in the schematic, and an arbitrary number of
    contact locations in the <a href="xic:symbl">schematic symbol</a>. 
    The schematic value is separated from the symbolic values by a
    colon.  The symbolic values are separated from each other by
    commas.  If the 3.2 format is being written due to the
    <b>Out32nodes</b> variable being set, at most one number will
    appear following the colon, the first that would otherwise be
    listed if there are multiple contact points.

    <p>
    If there is no symbolic representation, or the terminal location
    has not been set in the symbolic view, the <i>elecX</i> and
    <i>elecY</i> each consist of a single number.  In the more
    general case, both terms should supply the same number of
    integers.

    <p>
    The remaining tokens are optional.  The <i>flagstype</i> is a hex
    integer that if present <b>must</b> be prefixed with "<tt>0x</tt>"
    or "<tt>0X</tt>".  The least significant byte contains a value
    that specifies a terminal type.  This is a numerical equivalent of
    the optional <i>type_name</i> which appears in the old 3.2 format
    syntax.  The values and keywords are listed below.  <i>Xic</i>
    does not presently use this.

    <blockquote>

    The remainder of the word may contain any of the following
    flag bits.
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>0x100</tt> (BYNAME)<dd>
    The terminal will associate to a wire net by name, there will be no
    connectivity due to placement location in the schematic.
    <dt><tt>0x200</tt> (VIRTUAL)<dd>
    The terminal is "virtual" meaning that there is no wire vertex or
    subcircuit or device contact at the terminal's location in the
    schematic.  This is irrelevant if the BYNAME flag is set.
    <dt><tt>0x400</tt> (FIXED)<dd>
    It set, <i>Xic</i> will not move the corresponding physical
    terminal location in the layout.  This indicates that the location
    has been "locked" by the user.
    <dt><tt>0x800</tt> (INVIS)<dd>
    The terminal will be invisible in the schematic, except when the
    <a href="xic:subct"><b>subct</b></a> command from the side menu,
    used for terminal editing, is active.  The corresponding terminal
    in the layout will show normally.
    </dl>

    The <i>name</i> is the terminal name.  This is either a short name
    provided by the user, or if not provided a default name will be
    created by <i>Xic</i>.  The name is unique among the cell's
    terminals.

    <p>
    If the cell has a physical counterpart, the remaining arguments
    have significance.  In particular, if the cell has no physical
    counterpart, or the node has no physical counterpart, the
    remaining parameters should not appear.  The lack of physical
    coordinates informs the reader that this terminal has no physical
    counterpart.  The coordinates should be set to zero in device
    cells that have a physical implementation.

    <p>
    If the node has a corresponding physical implementation in the
    layout, the <i>physX</i> and <i>physY</i> will be given.  When the
    property is being read, the presence of these numbers indicates
    that internal setup to link to the layout is required.  If both
    numbers don't appear, the node will exist in the schematic only. 
    This is appropriate for devices that don't have a physical
    implementation, such as voltage sources, or for cases like the
    phase node of a Josephson junction, or in the case where there is
    no layout.  In output, if the physical association exists.  the
    two numbers give the corresponding point in the layout.  These
    will be nonzero if the corresponding location has been identified,
    either by running extraction, or if the location was set by hand.

    <p>
    It is not necessarily true that all nodes of the device either
    have or don't have the optional parameters.  The phase node of a
    Josephson junction device, for example, does not have a physical
    counterpart.  The other two nodes do have physical
    implementations, since these are the physical connection points. 
    A side-effect is that in SPICE files extracted from physical data
    only the two nodes will appear in the device instantiation lines. 
    This is acceptable to <i>WRspice</i>, since the phase node is
    optional.  If a device has no nodes with the optional parameters
    given, then it can never have a physical counterpart.  The <a
    href="prpty:nophys"><b>nophys</b></a> property should also be
    given in that case.  This is true for devices like voltage sources
    that have no physical implementation.

    <p>
    If the physical location is valid, a <i>layer_name</i> will be
    provided.  This is the name of a physical layer which has the
    <tt>Conductor</tt> attribute, and an object on this layer touches
    or is under the physical location.

    In the old 3.2 format, the flags values are the following:
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>0x2</tt> (VIRTUAL)<dd>
    The terminal is "virtual" meaning that there is no wire vertex or
    subcircuit or device contact at the terminal's location in the
    schematic.  This is irrelevant if the BYNAME flag is set.
    <dt><tt>0x4</tt> (FIXED)<dd>
    It set, <i>Xic</i> will not move the corresponding physical
    terminal location in the layout.  This indicates that the location
    has been "locked" by the user.
    </dl>

    In the old format, instead of a numerical type code, an optional
    <i>type_name</i> can be given.  This is one of the keywords from
    the table shown earlier.
    </dl>

    <a name="name"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>name</b> property, number 11<dd>
    The <b>name</b> property gives the device an identifying prefix or
    name.  If a name has been assigned to the device with the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a> panel or equivalent,
    that name will be used in SPICE output.  Otherwise, the name
    prefix is suffixed with a unique integer generated by <i>Xic</i>
    to form the name.  SPICE expects that the first character of the
    name match the convention for the device, for example, resistors
    use R, capacitors C, etc (see the SPICE <a
    href="elements">documentation</a>).

    <p>
    Cell property, <tt>macro</tt> flag is set:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 11</tt> <i>prefix</i> <tt>macro</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Cell property, <i>prefix</i> starts with <tt>X</tt> or <tt>x</tt>:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 11</tt> <i>prefix</i> <tt>0 subckt</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Cell property, otherwise:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 11</tt> <i>prefix</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Cell instance property:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 11</tt> <i>prefix</i><tt>.</tt><i>assigned_name</i> <i>devnum</i>
      [<tt>subckt</tt> [<i>physX physY</i>]];
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>prefix</i> is the default name prefix, and should conform
    to the SPICE conventions.  The <i>assigned_name</i>, if present,
    will be used in actual SPICE output.  The <i>assigned_name</i>
    should <b>not</b> be present in device definitions; it is used in
    cell files for device instances to which a name has been assigned
    with the <b>Property Editor</b>.  The <i>prefix</i> can start with
    any character, but is intended to have significance to SPICE.  The
    character '<tt>@</tt>' is reserved for the terminal device.  The
    <i>assigned_name</i> can be any contiguous string.  The
    <i>devnum</i> is an index assigned by <i>Xic</i> to the device,
    and is used when forming the default device name.  When reading,
    this value is ignored

    <p>
    The <b>name</b> property for cells contains an internal
    <tt>mactro</tt> flag, which replaces the <a
    href="prpty:macro"><b>macro</b></a> property in 4.3.6 and later. 
    This flag will be set if any of the following apply:

    <ol>
    <li>Exactly two words are given, i.e., a single word follows
    the <i>prefix</i>, which can be anything.
    <li>The word "<tt>macro</tt>" appears in a third word, following
    an integer.
    <li>A <b>macro</b> property is found.
    </ol>
    This syntax is backwards compatible with release 4.3.5 and earlier.

    <p>
    When the <tt>macro</tt> flag is set, its only effect is that in
    SPICE output, an '<tt>X</tt>' is prepended to the device name in
    device instantiation lines.  Thus, SPICE will treat the device
    instance as a subcircuit call.  These instances must have a <a
    href="prpty:model"><b>model</b></a> property that will match a
    <tt>.subckt</tt> definition somewhere, likely from a PDK device
    model file.

    <p>
    This accounts for devices that are likely the electrical part of
    parameterized cells, that implement nonlinear behavior through
    a network of controlled sources expressed as a subcircuit in the
    SPICE model definitions file.  MOS capacitors and poly resistors
    are devices that are frequently modeled this way.

    <p>
    If the <tt>macro</tt> flag is set and the <i>prefix</i> already
    begins with <tt>X</tt> or <tt>x</tt>, the device is taken as a
    macro, meaning that <i>Xic</i> will not output a subcircuit
    definition for the cell, and a <b>model</b> property will provide the
    name of a subcircuit definition expected to be found in the model
    library or elsewhere.

    <p>
    The name property for instances is printed as shown.  The
    "<tt>subckt</tt>" appears if <i>prefix</i> starts with
    "<tt>X</tt>" or "<tt>x</tt>" and <tt>macro</tt> is <b>not</b> set
    in the master.  Coordinates additionally appear if a physical
    label was placed (in extraction).  This is where the physical
    subcircuit instance label is located.  All but the <i>prefix</i>
    and <i>assigned_name</i> (if any) are ignored by the reader, but
    can be seen printed in native cell files (for example).

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> generates the internal device or subcircuit index, used
    as part of the default device or subcircuit name, according to the
    position of the upper-left corner of the bounding box of the
    object.  The numbering starts with zero, and increases for
    positions with smaller Y value, or with larger X value for devices
    with the same Y coordinate.  Each device and subcircuit type has
    its own numbering.
    </dl>

    <a name="labloc"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>labloc</b> property, number 12<dd>
    The <b>name</b>, <b>model</b>, <b>value</b>, <b>param</b> and
    <b>devref</b> property values are normally displayed on-screen
    near the device body.  This is a device property for setting the
    default locations of the property labels when shown on-screen.  If
    this property does not appear, the internal default locations are
    used.  This property allows more control over label placement, on
    a per-device basis.  This property should only be used in devices
    in the device library file.  Presently, the property can only be
    added with a text editor by editing the property strings in the
    device library file.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 12</tt> <i>pname code</i> [ <i>pname code</i> ] ... ;
    </blockquote>

    The <i>pname</i> is one of the literal tokens "<tt>name</tt>",
    "<tt>model</tt>", "<tt>value</tt>", "<tt>param</tt>", and
    "<tt>devref</tt>".  For backward compatibility, "<tt>initc</tt>"
    is accepted as an alias for "<tt>param</tt>".  The <i>code</i> is
    an integer, -1 - 23.  If the <i>code</i> is -1, the default
    placement is used.  If code is 0 - 23, the placement and
    justification are as shown in the figure.  The '.' position
    implies the justification.  Horizontally, all are left or right
    justified except for 16 and 19 which are centered.  Similarly,
    vertical justification is bottom or top except for 17 and 18 which
    are center justified.

    <p>
    <img src="cpos33.png" border=1>

    The default locations are shwon in the table below.  The locations
    differ when the height of the placement bounding box is less than
    or greater than the width.

    <dt><b>oldmut</b> property, number 13<dd>
    This property was once used for compatibility with the mutual
    inductors used in the schematic files produced by the
    <tt>Jspice3</tt> program.  The format should not be used, and is
    not documented.
    </dl>

    <a name="mut"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>mut</b> property, number 14<dd>
    This property appears with the properties of cells containing
    mutual inductors, and is not copied to instantiations of the cell. 
    Mutual inductors do not appear as devices in the device library
    file, rather, they are implemented with this property.  Mutual
    properties are generated by selecting the "<b>mut</b>" device from
    the <a href="xic:devs">device menu</a>, with one property assigned
    for each mutual inductor pair in the circuit.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 14</tt> <i>num name1 num1 name2 num2 coeff</i> [<i>name</i>];
    </blockquote>

    This property appears only in the list for cell definitions, and
    not for instances.  It defines a mutual inductor pair within the
    cell.  The <i>num</i> is the index of the mutual inductor pair,
    used in forming the default specification to SPICE: 
    "<tt>K</tt><i>num</i>".  However, if the <i>name</i> appears
    (supplied in <i>Xic</i> by using the label editor on a mutual
    inductor label), the SPICE specification will use <i>name</i>
    (without <i>num</i>).  The <i>name1</i>, <i>num1</i>,
    <i>name2</i>, <i>num2</i> are the prefixes and assigned numbers of
    the inductors in the mutual inductor pair.  The <i>coeff</i> is a
    string which represents the coupling factor as given to SPICE.
    </dl>

    <a name="branch"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>branch</b> property, number 15<dd>
    The <b>branch</b> property is used to define a "hot spot" that
    when clicked on yields a device parameter, such as device current,
    which can be used in plots.  In SPICE, voltage sources and
    inductors have internal storage for current values present by
    default.  Other device parameters may require additional
    computational or storage overhead.  If the <b>branch</b>
    property is given in the device definition in the device library
    file, it is added to instantiated devices by <i>Xic</i>.

    <blockquote>
      <tt>5 15</tt> <i>x y dx dy</i> [<i>string</i>];
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values specify the hot spot where the
    branch current can be accessed by clicking.  The next two numbers
    specify the assumed direction of current flow.  They are
    interpreted as a unit vector directed outward from the origin
    along the +/- x or y axes.  Thus,

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>direction</th> <th><i>dx</i></th> <th><i>dy</i></th></tr>
    <tr><td>+y</td>   <td align=right>0</td> <td align=right>1</td><tr>
    <tr><td>-y</td>   <td align=right>0</td> <td align=right>-1</td><tr>
    <tr><td>+x</td>   <td align=right>1</td> <td align=right>0</td><tr>
    <tr><td>-x</td>   <td align=right>-1</td> <td align=right>0</td><tr>
    </table>

    are the options.  The <i>string</i> will be expanded and added to
    the token list in the prompt line when the branch is selected for
    plotting.

    <p>
    When the hot spot is clicked on, an expression will be produced
    which after expansion is added to the input line in the <a
    href="xic:plot"><b>plot</b></a> command.  The <i>string</i> token
    can contain the following literal tokens, which will be replaced
    with the appropriate values during expansion:

    <dl><dt><tt>&#60</tt><tt>v></tt>     <dd>Voltage across the device</dl>
    <dl><dt><tt>&#60</tt><tt>value></tt> <dd>The value property</dl>
    <dl><dt><tt>&#60</tt><tt>name></tt>  <dd>The device name</dl>

    <p>
    Anything else in the <i>string</i> will be copied literally.  If
    the <i>string</i> is absent, the expression will be
    <tt>&#60</tt><tt>name>#branch</tt>.

    <p>
    Examples:<br>
    for a resistor, the string is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>&#60</tt><tt>v>/&#60</tt><tt>value></tt>
    </blockquote>
    to return the current.  Similarly for a capacitor:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>&#60</tt><tt>value>*deriv(&#60</tt><tt>v>)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Thus the current will be computed using the <i>WRspice</i>
    <tt>deriv</tt> function.  For an inductor or voltage source, no
    string is required, as the default
    <blockquote>
    <tt>&#60</tt><tt>name>#branch</tt>
    </blockquote>
    is appropriate.  For a current source, one can use
    <blockquote>
    <tt>@&#60</tt><tt>name>[c]</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This works through the <i>WRspice</i>
    <tt>@</tt><i>device</i>[<i>param</i>] mechanism, however the
    vector must be saved, most conveniently by setting the <a
    href="devlib"><b>LibSave</b></a> global property for the device.
    </dl>

    <a name="labref"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>labref</b> property, number 16<dd>
    The <b>labref</b> property is applied by <i>Xic</i> to labels that
    are associated with device properties or wire nodes.  The property
    is not used in the device library file.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 16</tt> <i>name num property</i><br>
    <tt>5 16</tt> <i>x y</i> <tt>10</tt>;
    </blockquote>

    This property applies only to labels, and indicates that the label
    is to be bound to a given property of a certain device or mutual
    inductor, or wire.

    <p>
    The first form applies to a label for an instance or mutual
    inductor property.  Bound labels automatically reflect changes in
    the underlying property string, and may be used to set the string
    using the label editing function in <i>Xic</i>.  The <i>name</i>
    and <i>num</i> are the device prefix and assigned number of the
    device to which the label is bound.  The <i>property</i> is the
    property number of the bound property.  If the label is assigned
    to a mutual inductor pair, the <i>name</i> is `<tt>K</tt>'.

    <p>
    The second form applies to labels that have been attached to a
    wire, and are used to contribute a name for the net containing
    the wire.  The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> specify the coordinates of a
    vertex of the wire.  The <tt>10</tt> is the value of the
    <b>node</b> property.
    </dl>

    <a name="mutlrf"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>mutlrf</b> property, number 17<dd>
    This property is assigned to inductor instances which are
    referenced for use in mutual inductor pairs.  One such property
    exists per reference.  It is not used in device library files.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 17 mutual;</tt>
    </blockquote>

    This property applies only to inductors that are referenced as one
    of a mutual inductor pair.  There can be several such properties
    if the inductor is associated with multiple mutual inductor pairs.
    </dl>

    <a name="symbolic"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>symbolic</b> property, number 18<dd>
    The <b>symbolic</b> property is a property applied to cells
    which have a symbolic view associated.  It does not appear in
    device library files, as all devices are essentially symbolic.  It
    is not inherited by instances.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 18 0/1</tt> <i>geometry_spec</i>;
    </blockquote>

    The third field is nonzero if the symbolic mode is active, and 0
    if symbolic mode is inactive.  The <i>geometry_spec</i> is a
    string of separated CIF primitives for the symbolic
    representation, which can include L, B, P, W, and 94 (label)
    directives.  Each record (CIF primitive) is terminated by a colon
    (<b>not</b> a semicolon!) which must be immediately followed by an
    end-of-line character.  Colons that are not at the end of a text
    line will <b>not</b> terminate a record.

    <p>
    The <b>symbolic</b> property may be applied to subcircuit
    instances, in which case it will negate the effect of a
    <b>symbolic</b> property found in the instance master cell.  In
    this utilization, the property is named <b>nosymb</b>.  The flag
    and <i>geometry_spec</i> are ignored and need not be provided.  A
    subcircuit instance with this property would (in all cases) be
    displayed as expanded.  Thus, it is possible in <i>Xic</i> to have
    different instances of the same subcircuit cell master display
    symbolically and expanded within the same containing cell.
    </dl>

    <a name="nodemap"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>nodemap</b> property, number 19<dd>
    The <b>nodemap</b> property is applied to the electrical cell
    definition and is not inherited by instances.  The <b>nodemap</b>
    property provides a mapping between internally generated node
    numbers and assigned textual names.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>5 19 0/1</tt> <i>name x y name x y ...</i>;
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The third token can be 0 or 1, but is unused.  In releases prior
    to 3.1.5, a 0 value would disable the node map.  In current
    releases, node mapping is always enabled.

    <p>
    The remainder of the line consists of triples containing an
    assigned name and a coordinate pair.  The coordinates correspond
    to a device or subcircuit terminal connected to the assigned node,
    and serve as the reference to that node.  See <a
    href="xic:nodmp"><b>nodmp</b></a> for more information on node
    mapping.
    </dl>

    The "global" properties are added to the electrical top level cell
    of a hierarchy when being saved.  They save plot points and other
    information in the file, to use as defaults when the file is
    subsequently loaded for editing.

    <a name="prpty:run"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>run</b> property, number 7101<dd>
    The <b>run</b> property string specifies the default analysis
    command entered when the <a href="xic:run"><b>run</b></a> button
    is pressed, which initiates a simulation.
    </dl>

    <a name="prpty:plot"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>plot</b> property, number 7102<dd>
    The <b>plot</b> property string represents the plot points used in

!!LATEX elecpropxic properties.tex
The properties that are set by {\Xic} in electrical mode are described
below.  The electrical property values use the integers 1--21.  The
values 22--30 are reserved for future use.

\begin{description}
\index{bnode property}
\index{properties!bnode}
\item{\et bnode} property, number 9\\
The {\et bnode} property identifies the location of a ``bus
connector'' which is used to specify multiple connections to a device
or subcircuit.  It may appear in subcircuit cell definitions and
instance references.

\begin{quote}{\vt
5 9} {\it index beg\_range end\_range x y};
\end{quote}

The {\it index} is a non-negative integer index which serves to link
the bus node to an existing node with the same index.  The {\it
beg\_range} and {\it end\_range} are non-negative integers which set
the indexing of the bus.  The bus bit indices range from {\it
beg\_range} through {\it end\_range}.  Note that the numbers can be
ascending or descending.  The ``bit'' for {\it beg\_range} is
connected to the node with the given {\it index}.  The ``bit'' for
{\it end\_range} is connected to the node with index equal to {\it
index} + {\vt abs(}{\it beg\_range} - {\it end\_range\/}{\vt )}.  If
no node property has an equal index value, then that ``bit'' is simply
open.

For cells, the {\it elecX} and {\it elecY} each have the general form
\begin{quote}
{\it schemX\/}[{\vt :}{\it symbX\/}[{\vt ,}{\it symbX} ...]]
\end{quote}
and similar for the Y values.  This represents a single X,Y contact
location in the schematic, and an arbitrary number of contact
locations in the schematic symbol.  The schematic value is separated
from the symbolic values by a colon.  The symbolic values are
separated from each other by commas.  If the 3.2 format is being
written due to the {\et Out32nodes} variable being set, at most one
number will appear following the colon, the first that would otherwise
be listed if there are multiple contact points.

If there is no symbolic representation, or the terminal location has
not been set in the symbolic view, the {\it elecX} and {\it elecY}
each consist of a single number.  In the more general case, both terms
should supply the same number of integers.

In cell instances, there is no colon delimiter, and the general form
is simply a comma-separated list of numbers.  This is all identical to
the coordinate specification for a {\et node} property.

\index{node property}
\index{properties!node}
\item{\et node} property, number 10\\
The {\et node} property defines a circuit connection point.  It
appears as a property of wires, device and subcircuit instances, and
cells.  Its string is a bit different in the three cases.

Wire property\\
\begin{quote}{\vt
5 10} {\it circuit\_node}
\end{quote}

Any text that follows the form shown above is ignored.  The {\it
circuit\_node} is the node number in the current cell of the net
containing the wire.  All wires that participate in connectivity,
i.e., on the {\vt SCED} layer and any layer with the {\vt WireActive}
technology file keyword applied, should have a {\et node} property.

Instance property\\
\begin{quote}{\vt
5 10} {\it circuit\_node index elecX  elecY\/} [{\it name\/}]
\end{quote}

A subcircuit or device instance will have one {\et node} property per
circuit connection.  The {\it circuit\_node} is the node number of the
connection in the current cell.  The {\it index} is the terminal
ordering parameter.  Each {\et node} property of an instance will have
a unique {\it index\/}.  The indices form a compact run starting with
0.

The {\it elecX} and {\it elecY}, are integers, or comma-separated
lists of integers.  Both terms specify the same number of integers. 
Taken as ordered X,Y values, these provide the ``hot spots'' where
connection to the terminal can be made.  {\Xic} allows an arbitrary
number of hot spots per node.  If the {\et Out32nodes} variable is
set, which forces output compatible with earlier {\Xic} releases, the
{\it elecX} and {\it elecY} will each consist of a single value, the
first in the list that would otherwise be output if there are multiple
contact points.

Internally, there are 1000 integer counts per ``micron'', and hot
spots must appear on a 1 ``micron'' (1000 unit) grid.  In a cell file,
scaling may be applied.  In particular, the default for CIF and native
cell files is 100 units per micron, but this is usually changed to
1000 units with the {\vt RESOLUTION 1000} directive.  Anyway, if a
user is for some reason writing a node property string by hand, the
hot spot locations must be chosen appropriately, arbitrary locations
do not work.

Anything that follows is actually ignored by the reader.  The
terminal's name is printed in output since it might be of interest to
humans.

Cell property\\
\begin{quote}{\vt
5 10} {\it circuit\_node index elecX elecY\/} [{\vt 0x}{\it flagstype
 name phyX physY layer\_name\/}];
\end{quote}

Cell property, old 3.2 syntax\\
\begin{quote}{\vt
5 10} {\it circuit\_node index elecX elecY\/} [{\it name phyX physY
 flags layer\_name type\_name\/}];
\end{quote}

The {\et node} properties applied to a cell make it possible for the
cell to be instantiated and used as a subcircuit (or device) in
another cell.

The property string parser can recognize and read the old release 3.2
string format for compatibility.  When writing output in any file
format, if the variable {\et Out32nodes} is set, the old string format
will be generated.  This will, however, strip out multiple contact
points if any have been defined, as this is not supported by the older
format, which allows exactly one contact per node.  The variable
tracks the {\cb Use back-compatible format (warning!  data loss)}
check box in the {\cb Export Control} panel from the {\cb Export
Cell Data} button in the {\cb Convert Menu}.

The {\it circuit\_node} is the node number in the current cell where
contact is to be made.  In a device cell that has no internal nodes,
this will be -1.  The {\it index} is an ordering parameter as
discussed above.  Index zero is the reference node.  When the device
or subcircuit is placed in a schematic, the location of the reference
node corresponds to where the user clicks.

The {\it elecX} and {\it elecY} each have the general form
\begin{quote}
{\it schemX\/}[{\vt :}{\it symbX\/}[{\vt ,}{\it symbX} ...]]
\end{quote}
and similar for the Y values.  This represents a single X,Y contact
location in the schematic, and an arbitrary number of contact
locations in the schematic symbol.  The schematic value is separated
from the symbolic values by a colon.  The symbolic values are
separated from each other by commas.  If the 3.2 format is being
written due to the {\et Out32nodes} variable being set, at most one
number will appear following the colon, the first that would otherwise
be listed if there are multiple contact points.

If there is no symbolic representation, or the terminal location has
not been set in the symbolic view, the {\it elecX} and {\it elecY}
each consist of a single number.  In the more general case, both terms
should supply the same number of integers.

The remaining tokens are optional.  The {\it flagstype} is a hex
integer that if present {\bf must} be prefixed with ``{\vt 0x}'' or
``{\vt 0X}''.  The least significant byte contains a value that
specifies a terminal type.  This is a numerical equivalent of the
optional {\it type\_name} which appears in the old 3.2 format
syntax.  The values and keywords are listed below.  {\Xic} does not
presently use this.

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\bf value & \bf keyword\\
0 & {\vt input} (default)\\
1 & \vt output\\
2 & \vt inout\\
3 & \vt tristate\\
4 & \vt clock\\
5 & \vt outclock\\
6 & \vt supply\\
7 & \vt outsupply\\
8 & \vt ground\\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

The remainder of the word may contain any of the following flag bits.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt 0x100} (BYNAME)\\
The terminal will associate to a wire net by name, there will be no
connectivity due to placement location in the schematic.

\item{\vt 0x200} (VIRTUAL)\\
The terminal is ``virtual'' meaning that there is no wire vertex or
subcircuit or device contact at the terminal's location in the
schematic.  This is irrelevant if the BYNAME flag is set.

\item{\vt 0x400} (FIXED)\\
It set, {\Xic} will not move the corresponding physical terminal
location in the layout.  This indicates that the location has been
``locked'' by the user.

\item{\vt 0x800} (INVIS)\\
The terminal will be invisible in the schematic, except when the {\cb
subct} command from the side menu, used for terminal editing, is
active.  The corresponding terminal in the layout will show normally.
\end{description}

The {\it name} is the terminal name.  This is either a short name
provided by the user, or if not provided a default name will be
created by {\Xic}.  The name is unique among the cell's terminals.

If the cell has a physical counterpart, the remaining arguments have
significance.  In particular, if the cell has no physical counterpart,
or the node has no physical counterpart, the remaining parameters
should not appear.  The lack of physical coordinates informs the
reader that this terminal has no physical counterpart.  The
coordinates should be set to zero in device cells that have a physical
implementation.

If the node has a corresponding physical implementation in the layout,
the {\it physX} and {\it physY} will be given.  When the property is
being read, the presence of these numbers indicates that internal
setup to link to the layout is required.  If both numbers don't
appear, the node will exist in the schematic only.  This is
appropriate for devices that don't have a physical implementation,
such as voltage sources, or for cases like the phase node of a
Josephson junction, or in the case where there is no layout.  In
output, if the physical association exists.  the two numbers give the
corresponding point in the layout.  These will be nonzero if the
corresponding location has been identified, either by running
extraction, or if the location was set by hand.

It is not necessarily true that all nodes of the device either have or
don't have the optional parameters.  The phase node of a Josephson
junction device, for example, does not have a physical counterpart. 
The other two nodes do have physical implementations, since these are
the physical connection points.  A side-effect is that in SPICE files
extracted from physical data only the two nodes will appear in the
device instantiation lines.  This is acceptable to {\WRspice},
since the phase node is optional.  If a device has no nodes with the
optional parameters given, then it can never have a physical
counterpart.  The {\et nophys} property should also be given in that
case.  This is true for devices like voltage sources that have no
physical implementation.

If the physical location is valid, a {\it layer\_name} will be provided. 
This is the name of a physical layer which has the {\et Conductor}
attribute, and an object on this layer touches or is under the
physical location.

In the old 3.2 format, the flags values are the following:
\begin{description}
\item{\vt 0x2} (VIRTUAL)\\
The terminal is ``virtual'' meaning that there is no wire vertex or
subcircuit or device contact at the terminal's location in the
schematic.  This is irrelevant if the BYNAME flag is set.

\item{\vt 0x4} (FIXED)\\
It set, {\Xic} will not move the corresponding physical terminal
location in the layout.  This indicates that the location has been
``locked'' by the user.
\end{description}

In the old format, instead of a numerical type code, an optional {\it
type\_name} can be given.  This is one of the keywords from the table
shown earlier.

\index{name property}
\index{properties!name}
\item{\et name} property, number 11\\
The {\et name} property gives the device an identifying prefix or
name.  If a name has been assigned to the device with the {\cb
Property Editor} panel or equivalent, that name will be used in SPICE
output.  Otherwise, the name prefix is suffixed with a unique integer
generated by {\Xic} to form the name.  SPICE expects that the first
character of the name match the convention for the device, for
example, resistors use R, capacitors C, etc.~(see the SPICE
documentation).

Cell property, {\vt macro} flag set:
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 11} {\it prefix} {\vt macro}
\end{quote}
Cell property, {\it prefix} starts with {\vt X} or {\vt x}:
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 11} {\it prefix} {\vt 0 subckt}
\end{quote}
Cell property, otherwise:
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 11} {\it prefix}
\end{quote}

Cell instance property:
\begin{quote}
{\vt 5 11} {\it prefix\/}.{\it assigned\_name\/} {\it devnum}
[{\vt subckt} [{\it physX physY\/}]];
\end{quote}

The {\it prefix} is the default name prefix, and should conform to the
SPICE conventions.  The {\it assigned\_name\/}, if present, will be
used in actual spice output.  The {\it assigned\_name} should {\bf
not} be present in device definitions, it is used in cell files for
device instances to which a name has been assigned with the {\cb
Property Editor}.  The {\it prefix} can start with any character, but
is intended to have significance to SPICE.  The character `{\vt @}' is
reserved for the terminal device.  The {\it assigned\_name\/} can be
any contiguous string.  The {\it devnum} is an index assigned by
{\Xic} to the device, and is used when forming the default device
name.  When reading, this value is ignored.

The {\et name} property for cells contains an internal {\vt macro}
flag, which replaces the {\et macro} property in 4.3.6 and later. 
This flag will be set if any of the following apply:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Exactly two words are given, i.e., a single word follows the
{\it prefix\/}, which can be anything.}

\item{The word ``{\vt macro}'' appears in a third word, following an
integer.}

\item{A {\et macro} property is found.}
\end{enumerate}
This syntax is backwards compatible with release 4.3.5 and earlier.

When the {\vt macro} flag is set, its only effect is that in SPICE
output, an `{\vt X}' is prepended to the device name in device
instantiation lines.  Thus, SPICE will treat the device instance as a
subcircuit call.  These instances must have a {\et model} property
that will match a {\vt .subckt} definition somewhere, likely from a
PDK device model file.

This accounts for devices that are likely the electrical part of
parameterized cells, that implement nonlinear behavior through a
network of controlled sources expressed as a subcircuit in the SPICE
model definitions file.  MOS capacitors and poly resistors are devices
that are frequently modeled this way.

If the {\vt macro} flag is set and the {\it prefix} already begins
with {\vt X} or {\vt x}, the device is taken as a macro, meaning that
{\Xic} will not output a subcircuit definition for the cell, and a
{\et model} property will provide the name of a subcircuit definition
expected to be found in the model library or elsewhere.

The name property for instances is printed as shown.  The ``{\vt
subckt}'' appears if {\it prefix} starts with ``{\vt X}'' or ``{\vt
x}'' and {\et macro} is {\bf not} set in the master.  Coordinates
additionally appear if a physical label was placed (in extraction). 
This is where the physical subcircuit instance label is located.  All
but the {\it prefix} and {\it assigned\_name} (if any) are ignored by
the reader, but can be seen printed in native cell files (for example).

{\Xic} generates the internal device or subcircuit index, used as part
of the default device or subcircuit name, according to the position of
the upper-left corner of the bounding box of the object.  The
numbering starts with zero, and increases for positions with smaller Y
value, or with larger X value for devices with the same Y coordinate. 
Each device and subcircuit type has its own numbering.

\index{labloc property}
\index{properties!labloc}
\item{\et labloc} property, number 12\\
The {\et name}, {\et model}, {\et value}, {\et param}, and {\et
devref} property values are normally displayed on-screen near the
device body.  This is a device property for setting the default
locations of the property labels when shown on-screen.  If this
property does not appear, the internal default locations are used. 
This property allows more control over label placement, on a
per-device basis.  This property should only be used in devices in the
device library file.  Presently, the property can only be added with a
text editor by editing the property strings in the device library
file.

\begin{quote}\vt
5 12 {\it pname code} [ {\it pname code\/} ] ... ;
\end{quote}

The {\it pname} is one of the literal tokens ``{\vt name}'', ``{\vt
model}'', ``{\vt value}'', ``{\vt param}'', and ``{\vt devref}''.  For
backward compatibility, ``{\vt initc}'' is accepted as an alias for
``{\vt param}''.  The {\it code} is an integer, -1 -- 23.  If the {\it
code} is -1, the default placement is used.  If code is 0 -- 23, the
placement and justification are as shown in the figure:  The '.'
position implies the justification.  Horizontally, all are left or
right justified except for 16 and 19 which are centered.  Similarly,
vertical justification is bottom or top except for 17 and 18 which are
center justified.

\begin{figure}

codes around the device bounding box.}

The default locations are shwon in the table below.  The locations
differ when the height of the placement bounding box is less than or
greater than the width.
 
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\end{tabular}

\index{oldmut property}
\index{properties!oldmut}
\item{\et oldmut} property, number 13\\
This property is used for compatibility with the mutual inductors used
in the schematic files produced by the {\et Jspice3} program.  The
format should not be used, and is not documented.

\index{mut property}
\index{properties!mut}
\item{\et mut} property, number 14\\
This property appears with the properties of cells containing mutual
inductors, and is not copied to instantiations of the cell.  Mutual
inductors do not appear as devices in the device library file, rather,
they are implemented with this property.  Mutual properties are
generated by selecting the ``{\et mut}'' device from the device
menu, with one property assigned for each mutual inductor pair in
the circuit.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 14 {\it num name1 num1 name2 num2 coeff} [{\it name\/}];
\end{quote}

This property appears only in the list for cell definitions, and not
for instances.  It defines a mutual inductor pair within the cell. 
The {\it num} is the index of the mutual inductor pair, used in
forming the default specification to SPICE: ``{\vt K}{\it num\/}''. 
However, if the {\it name} appears (supplied in {\Xic} by using the
label editor on a mutual inductor label), the SPICE specification will
use {\it name\/} (without {\it num\/}).  The {\it name1, num1, name2,
num2} are the prefixes and assigned numbers of the inductors in the
mutual inductor pair.  The {\it coeff} is a string which represents
the coupling factor as given to SPICE.

\index{branch property}
\index{properties!branch}
\item{\et branch} property, number 15\\
The {\et branch} property is used to define a ``hot spot'' that when
clicked on yields a device parameter, such as device current, which
can be used in plots.  In SPICE, voltage sources and inductors have
internal storage for current values present by default.  Other device
parameters may require additional computational or storage overhead. 
If the {\et branch} property is given in the device definition in the
device library file, it is added to instantiated devices by {\Xic}.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 15 {\it x y dx dy} [{\it string\/}];
\end{quote}

The {\it x} and {\it y} values specify the hot spot where the branch
current can be accessed by clicking.  The next two numbers specify the
assumed direction of current flow.  They are interpreted as a unit
vector directed outward from the origin along the $+/-$ x or y axes. 
Thus,
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
direction & \it dx & \it dy\\
$+$y &  0 & 1\\
$-$y &  0 & $-$1\\
$+$x &  1 & 0\\
$-$x & $-$1 & 0
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
are the options.  The {\it string} will be expanded and added to
the token list in the prompt line when the branch is selected for
plotting.

When the hot spot is clicked on, an expression will be produced which
after expansion is added to the input line in the {\cb plot} command. 
The {\it string} token can contain the following literal tokens, which
will be replaced with the appropriate values during expansion:

\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
\vt <v>      & Voltage across the device\\
\vt <value>  & The ``value'' property\\
\vt <name>   & The device name
\end{tabular}\\

Anything else in the {\it string} will be copied literally.  If the
string is absent, the expression will be ``{\vt <name>\#branch}''.

Here are some examples.
for a resistor, the string is
\begin{quote}
 {\vt <v>/<value>}
\end{quote}
to return the current.  Similarly for a capacitor,
\begin{quote}
 {\vt <value>*deriv(<v>)}.
\end{quote}
Thus the current will be computed using the {\WRspice} {\vt deriv}
function.  For an inductor or voltage source, no string is required,
as the default
\begin{quote}
 {\vt <name>\#branch}
\end{quote}
is appropriate.  For a current source, one can use
\begin{quote}
 {\vt @<name>[c]}.
\end{quote}
This works through the {\WRspice} {\vt @{\it device\/}[{\it param\/}]}
mechanism, however the vector must be saved, most conveniently by
setting the {\et LibSave} global property for the device (see
\ref{devdotlib}).

\index{labrf property}
\index{properties!labrf}
\item{\et labref} property, number 16\\
The {\et labrf} property is applied by {\Xic} to labels that are
associated with device properties or wire nodes.  The property is not
used in the device library file.

\begin{quote}\vt
5 16 {\it name num property\/};
5 16 {\it x y} {\vt 10};
\end{quote}
This property applies only to labels, and indicates that the label is
to be bound to a given property of a certain device or mutual
inductor, or wire.

The first form applies to a label for an instance or mutual inductor
property.  Bound labels automatically reflect changes in the
underlying property string, and may be used to set the string using
the label editing function in {\Xic}.  The {\it name} and {\it num}
are the device prefix and assigned number of the device to which the
label is bound.  The {\it property} is the property number of the
bound property.  If the label is assigned to a mutual inductor pair,
the {\it name} is `{\vt K}'.

The second form applies to labels that have been attached to a wire,
and are used to contribute a name for the net containing the wire. 
The {\it x} and {\it y} specify the coordinates of a vertex of the
wire.  The {\vt 10} is the value of the {\et node} property.

\index{mutlrf property}
\index{properties!mutlrf}
\item{\et mutlrf} property, number 17\\
This property is assigned to inductor instances which are referenced
for use in mutual inductor pairs.  One such property exists per
reference.  It is not used in device library files.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 17 mutual;
\end{quote}
This property applies only to inductors that are referenced as one of
a mutual inductor pair.  There can be several such properties if the
inductor is associated with multiple mutual inductor pairs.

\index{symbolic property}
\index{properties!symbolic}
\index{nosymb property}
\index{properties!nosymb}
\item{\et symbolic} property, number 18\\
The {\et symbolic} property is a property applied to cells which have
a symbolic view associated.  It does not appear in device library
files, as all devices are essentially symbolic.  It is not inherited by
instances.
\begin{quote}\vt
5 18 0/1 {\it geometry\_spec};
\end{quote}
The third field is nonzero if the symbolic mode is active, and 0
if symbolic mode is inactive.  The {\it geometry\_spec} is a string of
separated CIF primitives for the symbolic representation, which can
include L, B, P, W, and 94 (label) directives.  Each record (CIF
primitive) is terminated by a colon ({\bf not} a semicolon!) which
must be immediately followed by an end-of-line character.  Colons that
are not at the end of a text line will {\bf not} terminate a record.

The {\et symbolic} property may be applied to subcircuit instances, in
which case it will negate the effect of a {\et symbolic} property
found in the instance master cell.  In this utilization, the property
is named {\cb nosymb}.  The flag and {\it geometry\_spec} are ignored
and need not be provided.  A subcircuit instance with this property
would (in all cases) be displayed as expanded.  Thus, it is possible
in {\Xic} to have different instances of the same subcircuit cell
master display symbolically and expanded within the same containing
cell.

\index{nodemap property}
\index{properties!nodemap}
\item{\et nodemap} property, number 19\\
The {\et nodemap} property is applied to the electrical cell
definition and is not inherited by instances.  The {\et nodemap}
property provides a mapping between internally generated node numbers
and assigned textual names. 

\begin{quote}\vt
5 19 0/1 {\it name x y name x y ...\/};
\end{quote}

The third token can be 0 or 1, but is unused.  In releases prior to
3.1.5, a 0 value would disable the node map.  In current releases,
node mapping is always enabled.

The remainder of the line consists of triples containing an assigned
name and a coordinate pair.  The coordinates correspond to a device or
subcircuit terminal connected to the assigned node, and serve as the
reference to that node.  See \ref{nodmp} for more information on node
mapping.
\end{description}

The ``global'' properties are added to the electrical top level cell
of a hierarchy when being saved.  They save plot points and other
information in the file, to use as defaults when the file is
subsequently loaded for editing.

\begin{description}
\index{properties!run}
\index{run property}
\item{\et run} property, number 7101\\
The {\et run} property string specifies the default analysis command
entered when the {\cb run} button is pressed which initiates a
simulation.

\index{plot property}
\index{properties!plot}
\item{\et plot} property, number 7102\\
The {\et Plot} property is used only in electrical mode.  The string
represents the plot points used in the {\cb plot} command, in the
format of arguments to the {\WRspice} {\vt plot} command.

\index{iplot property}
\index{properties!iplot}
\item{\et iplot} property, number 7103\\
The {\et Iplot} property is used in electrical mode.  The string
specifies the points to plot when using the {\cb iplot} button, in the
format of arguments to the {\WRspice} {\vt plot} command.
\end{description}

The strings for the {\et plot} and {\et iplot} properties may contain
special escape sequences indicating hypertext references or other
characteristics.  These are described in \ref{prpescapes}.

SPICE Device Line

    In SPICE, each line of a given device type begins with the device
    name, set by the <b>name</b> property.  This is followed by the
    device nodes, corresponding to the order of enumeration in the
    <i>device_node</i> of the <b>node</b> properties.  This is
    followed by text from the <b>devref</b> property, which is
    intended to provide a reference device name for current-controlled
    sources and the current-controlled switch.  It is not used
    generally.  This is followed by the <b>value</b> or <b>model</b>
    property (these are really just two different names for the same
    text field).  This is followed by the text of the <b>param</b>
    property.

    <p>
    The device name, if not assigned by the user with the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a>, and nodes are
    assigned by <i>Xic</i> so as to be unique.

    <p>
    The line looks like:
    <blockquote>
      <i>name</i> n<i>1</i> ... n<i>Last</i> <i>devref</i> <i>value/model</i>
      <i>parameter_string</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>name</i> is either the user assigned name, or the device
    prefix with a unique numerical suffix created by <i>Xic</i> if no
    name was assigned.  The nodes can be numbers or text tokens, in
    accordance with the current <a href="xic:nodmp">node name
    mapping</a>.  The remaining properties are read verbatim from the
    specifications, with <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a> references
    expanded.

    <p>
    Hypertext references are generated when assigning properties by
    clicking on devices or other features in the drawing.  Since
    <i>Xic</i> assigns device names and nodes, if one needs to
    reference a specific device or node, a hypertext reference
    provides a link which is independent of the assigned values, which
    can change.

    <p>
    When applied to subcircuit cells and instances, the <b>param</b>
    property provides support for <a href=".subckt">subcircuit
    parameterization</a>, which is available in <i>WRspice</i> and
    some other simulators.

    <p>
    Here is a brief description of how to use parameterization. 
    Suppose that you are editing a cell that contains a resistor, and
    you wish to parameterize the resistance value.  Give the
    resistor a <b>value</b> property consisting of some word, say
    "<tt>rshunt</tt>".  Using the <a href="xic:cprop"><b>Cell
    Properties Editor</b></a>, give the cell a <b>param</b> property
    something like "<tt>rshunt=2.5</tt>".  This will give the resistor
    a default value of 2.5 ohms.  Editing another cell, place two
    instances of the previous cell.  Using the <a
    href="xic:prpty"><b>Property Editor</b></a> give one of the
    instances a <b>param</b> property of "<tt>rshunt=5</tt>".  A label
    will appear containing this text.  The other instance will not
    have a similar label.  The resistor in the labeled subcircuit will
    have value 5, set by the <b>param</b> property applied to the
    instance.  The other instance will have resistance value 2.5, as
    set by the <b>param</b> property applied to the master, which
    serves as the default value.

In SPICE, Each line of a given device type begins with the device
name, set by the {\et name} property.  This is followed by the device
nodes, corresponding to the order of enumeration in the {\it
device\_node\/} of the {\et node} properties.  This is followed by

just two different names for the same text field).  This is followed
by the text of the {\et param} property.

The device name, if not assigned by the user with the {\cb Property
Editor} command, and nodes are assigned by {\Xic} so as to be unique.

The line looks like:
\begin{quote}
{\it name n1 ... nLast devref value\/}/{\it model parameter\_string}
\end{quote}

The {\it name} is either the user assigned name, or the device prefix
with a unique numerical suffix created by {\Xic} if no name was
assigned.  The nodes can be numbers or text tokens, in accordance with
the current node name mapping (see \ref{nodmp}).  The remaining
properties are read verbatim from the specifications, with hypertext
references expanded.

Hypertext references are generated when assigning properties by
clicking on devices or other features in the drawing.  Since {\Xic}
assigns device names and nodes, if one needs to reference a specific
device or node, a hypertext reference provides a link which is
independent of the assigned values, which can change.

When applied to subcircuit cells and instances, the {\cb param}
property provides support for subcircuit parameterization, which is
available in {\WRspice} and some other simulators.

Here is a brief description of how to use parameterization.  Suppose
that you are editing a cell that contains a resistor, and you wish to
parameterize the resistance value.  Give the resistor a {\et value}
property consisting of some word, say ``{\vt rshunt}''.  Using the
{\cb Cell Properties Editor}, give the cell a {\et param} property
something like ``{\vt rshunt=2.5}''.  This will give the resistor a
default value of 2.5 ohms.  Editing another cell, place two instances
of the previous cell.  Using the {\cb Property Editor} give one of the
instances a {\et param} property of ``{\vt rshunt=5}''.  A label will
appear containing this text.  The other instance will not have a
similar label.  The resistor in the labeled subcircuit will have value
5, set by the {\et param} property applied to the instance.  The
other instance will have resistance value 2.5, as set by the {\et
param} property applied to the master, which serves as the default
value.

    In property and label strings, there is a special encoding used to
    indicate certain attributes, such as <a
    href="hypertext">hypertext</a> references.  These are in the form:

    <blockquote>
    <tt>(||</tt><i>something</i><tt>||)</tt>
    </blockquote>

    The following forms are recognized by <i>Xic</i>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>(||sc||)</tt><dd>
    This sequence is simply converted to a semicolon ('<tt>;</tt>')
    when the string is internalized.  In CIF, semicolons can not be
    included in label or property strings, as the character is
    reserved for line termination.  <i>Xic</i> will convert
    semicolons in property strings and labels to this form when
    creating a CIF or native file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>(||text||)</tt><dd>
    This token may appear at the beginning of a label string, and
    indicates that the string is in <a href="longtext">long text</a>
    format.  These labels do not appear on-screen (the characters
    "<tt>[text]</tt>" appear instead), but the full string can be
    accessed with the <a href="xic:label">label editor</a>.  Thus,
    large blocks of text can be saved as properties or <a
    href="spicetext">spicetext</a> labels without crowding the
    screen.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>(||</tt><i>x</i>:<i>y type</i><tt>||)</tt><dd>
    This sequence indicates a hypertext reference, and can appear
    anywhere in a property or label string, in electrical data only. 
    Hypertext references are generated when assigning properties by
    clicking on other devices in the drawing.  Since <i>Xic</i> by
    default internally assigns device names and nodes, if one needs to
    reference a specific device or node, a hypertext reference
    provides a link which is independent of the assigned values, which
    can change.  The <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> is a coordinate, in internal
    units, giving a location for the reference.  This is generally the
    point where the user clicked to create the reference.  The
    space-separated integer that follows gives the type of the
    reference, and is one of:

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>node reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td>branch reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td> <td>device name reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td> <td>subcircuit name reference</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    In the case of a node reference, the coordinate must be over a
    connection point, or along a wire.  For a branch, the coordinate
    must be over a branch reference point of a device.  For a device
    name reference, the coordinate must be in or on the bounding box
    of a device.  For a subcircuit name reference, the coordinate must
    be in or on the bounding box of a subcircuit.

In property and label strings, there is a special encoding used to
indicate certain attributes, such as hypertext references.  These are
in the form:
\begin{quote}
{\vt (||}{\it something\/}{\vt ||)}
\end{quote}

The following forms are recognized by {\Xic}
\begin{description}
\item{\vt (||sc||)}\\
This sequence is simply converted to a semicolon (`{\vt ;}')
when the string is internalized.  In CIF, semicolons can not be
included in label or property strings, as the character is
reserved for line termination.  {\Xic} will convert
semicolons in property strings and labels to this form when
creating a CIF or native file.

\item{\vt (||text||)}\\
This token may appear at the beginning of a label string, and
indicates that the string is in long text format (see \ref{longtext}). 
These labels do not appear on-screen (the characters ``{\vt [text]}''
appear instead), but the full string can be accessed with the label
editor.  Thus, large blocks of text can be saved as properties or {\vt
spicetext} labels without crowding the screen.

\item{\vt (||}{\it x\/}:{\it y type\/}{\vt ||)}\\
This sequence indicates a hypertext reference, and can appear anywhere
in a property or label string, in electrical data only.  Hypertext
references are generated when assigning properties by clicking on
other devices in the drawing.  Since {\Xic} by default internally
assigns device names and nodes, if one needs to reference a specific
device or node, a hypertext reference provides a link which is
independent of the assigned values, which can change.  The {\it
x},{\it y} is a coordinate, in internal units, giving a location for
the reference.  This is generally the point where the user clicked to
create the reference.  The space-separated integer that follows gives
the type of the reference, and is one of:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1 & node reference\\
2 & branch reference\\
4 & device name reference\\
8 & subcircuit name reference\\
\end{tabular}

In the case of a node reference, the coordinate must be over a
connection point, or along a wire.  For a branch, the coordinate must
be over a branch reference point of a device.  For a device name
reference, the coordinate must be in or on the bounding box of a
device.  For a subcircuit name reference, the coordinate must be in or
on the bounding box of a subcircuit.

When the string is used, the hypertext reference is resolved, and
the actual text replaces the hypertext reference in the string.
