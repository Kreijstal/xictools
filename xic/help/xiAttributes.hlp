    The <b>Attributes Menu</b> contains commands primarily for
    modifying the presentation format of <i>Xic</i>.  Each <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-window</a> has an independent set of
    attributes, which are initially set to those of the main window.

Key Map

    <b>jump to</b> <a href="xic:keymp#kmapfile"><b>Key Mapping File</b></a>

    <p>
    Several of the keys which <i>Xic</i> uses are not found on all
    keyboards, or they may return a different code than <i>Xic</i>
    expects.  <i>Xic</i> contains a built-in facility for remapping
    keys from the keyboard to the functions expected in <i>Xic</i>,
    through the <b>Key Map</b> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>. 
    The user is prompted to press keys on the keyboard that will
    correspond to the various special keys such as <b>Page Up</b>,
    <b>Page Down</b>, <b>Home</b>, and numeric keypad <b>Add</b> and
    <b>Subtract</b>.  Only special function keys can be remapped, not
    the standard character entry keys, or modifier keys (e.g.,
    <b>Shift</b>, <b>Control</b>) and not the function keys 1-12.  If
    there is no response when a key is pressed and the pointer is in a
    drawing window, then that key can not be mapped.  To skip mapping
    of a key, press <b>Enter</b>.  To abort, press <b>Esc</b>.  When
    the prompting is finished, a file will be created in the current
    directory named <tt>xic_keymap</tt> by default.  The user is given
    the option to alter this name.

    <p>
    The file can be moved to a safe place if desired.  The keyboard
    mapping is not actually performed until this file is read by
    <i>Xic</i>, which must be done explicitly.  This differs from
    <i>Xic</i> releases earlier than 4.0.0, which attempted to
    automatically read a created mapping file.  There are two ways to
    accomplish reading the mapping file:

    <ol>
    <li>The <a href="!kmap"><b>!kmap</b></a> command:
      <tt>!kmap</tt> <i>mapfile</i><br>
    This command can be typed into the prompt line and will cause the
    named file to be read and the mapping asserted immediately.

    <li>The <a href="ReadKeymap"><tt>ReadKeymap</tt></a> script function:
      <tt>ReadKeymap(</tt><i>mapfile</i><tt>)</tt><br>
    The function can be run from any <a href="xicscript">script</a>. 
    In particular, this line can be added to a <a
    href="initfiles">startup script</a> (<tt>.xicstart</tt> or
    <tt>.xicinit</tt> file) to assert the mapping when <i>Xic</i>
    starts.
    </ol>

    <p>
    In either case, the <i>mapfile</i> is a path to a file as created
    with this command.  If the path is not rooted, the file is
    searched for relative to the current directory, the user's home
    directory, and through the library <a href="xicpaths">search
    path</a>, in that order.  The commands can be re-run with
    different mapping files at any time, the current mapping state
    reflects the most recent mapping applied.

    <a name="kmapfile"></a>
    <h4>Key Mapping File</h4>

    The file produced in this manner contains all key mapping and
    action translation tables used by <i>Xic</i>.  Although it is not
    really recommended, this file can be customized by the user, with
    a text editor.  The recommended way to alter a key sequence
    response is with a macro (see below), but there may be occasions
    where the mapping file should be changed to achieve a desired
    effect.  Contact Whiteley Research for assistance.

    <p>
    The name of the file is <tt>xic_keymap.</tt><i>hostname</i>, where
    <i>hostname</i> is the name of the machine.  When <i>Xic</i>
    starts, it looks for a file of this name in the current directory,
    then in the user's home directory, then in the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>.  If a file is found, it is read
    and processed.

    <p>
    The first section of the mapping file contains a listing of the
    keysyms for the special keys mapped with this command
    (<b>Home</b>, <b>Page Down</b>, etc.).  The keysym is a
    system-defined number assigned to that key.  In Unix/Linux,
    keysyms are defined in the X include file
    <tt>X11/keysymdef.h</tt>.

    <p>
    The next section of the file consists of the definition of the
    "macro suppression" character (described below).  This must be a
    printable ASCII character, surrounded by single quotes.

    <p>
    The third section contains a mapping table for keysyms to an
    internal code.  The first column contains the keysyms; a numeric
    value in Windows, or the standard name under Unix/Linux.  The
    second column is the internal code.  The third column is a subcode
    used only for function keys.

    <p>
    The next section contains an action table which maps actions
    before the keypress code is sent to any internal command in
    <i>Xic</i>.  In action tables, the first column is a code which is
    either an internal code, or the ASCII value of the keysym.  This
    is operating system dependent.  Under Unix/Linux, the keysym code
    for a printing character is simply the ASCII value of that
    character.  The internal code is interpreted numerically as a
    value (hex) 0 - 1f.  Ascii values are (hex) 20 - fe.  Other values
    are taken as keysyms.  Under Windows, the code is similar, but the
    Windows keysym is used.  The Windows keysym differs in that (1)
    the upper-case alpha characters must be specified rather than
    lower case, (2) for punctuation which is the Shift of a numeric
    key, the numeric key should be given, (3) for punctuation which is
    not a Shift value for a numeric key, a special keysym for that key
    should be given.

    <p>
    The second column is the modifier state.  The actions should be
    listed in order of most specific to least specific with regard to
    modifiers.  A value "0" in this column indicates "don't care". 
    Otherwise, the entry consists of one or more of "SHIFT", "CTRL",
    and "ALT", separated by a minus sign "-".  The actual modifier
    should be listed, even if a Shift state is implied by the value in
    column one.

    <p>
    For example, to select the '!' character, in Unix/Linux one has
    <blockquote>
       <tt>'!'        SHIFT</tt>
    </blockquote>
    in Windows, this would be
    <blockquote>
       <tt>'1'        SHIFT</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The third column in the action tables is the name of an action,
    which is defined internally in <i>Xic</i>.  This is the action
    performed when the keypress combination specified in columns one
    and two is detected.

    <p>
    The next section in the file is an action table that specifies
    actions to perform after the present <i>Xic</i> command processes
    the keypress.  Many of the <i>Xic</i> commands look for specific
    keys, and if that key is seen, further mapping is inhibited.  If
    the keypress is not used by the command, it is available for
    translation by this final table.

    <p>
    The last section of the file contains a "<tt>&#60Buttons></tt>"
    field which maps the functions of the mouse buttons under
    Unix/Linux.  This allows the functions of the buttons within
    <i>Xic</i> to be permuted.  However, the functions of the buttons
    with respect to the user interface, such as the mouse button used
    to engage user interface buttons and menu items, will not change. 
    This field is ignored under Windows.
!!LATEX xic:keymp attrmenu.tex
Several of the keys which {\Xic} uses are not found on all keyboards,
or they may return a different code than {\Xic} expects.  {\Xic}
contains a built-in facility for remapping keys from the keyboard to
the functions expected in {\Xic}, through the {\cb Key Map} button in
the {\cb Attributes Menu}.  The user is prompted to press keys on the
keyboard that will correspond to the various special keys such as {\kb
Page Up}, {\kb Page Down}, {\kb Home}, and numeric keypad {\kb Add}
and {\kb Subtract}.  Only special function keys can be remapped, not
the standard character entry keys, or modifier keys (e.g., {\kb
Shift}, {\kb Control}) and not the function keys 1--12.  If there is
no response when a key is pressed and the pointer is in a drawing
window, then that key can not be mapped.  To skip mapping of a key,
press {\kb Enter}.  To abort, press {\kb Esc}.  When the prompting is
finished, a file will be created in the current directory named {\vt
xic\_keymap} by default.  The user is given the option to alter this
name.

The file can be moved to a safe place if desired.  The keyboard
mapping is not actually performed until this file is read by {\Xic},
which must be done explicitly.  This differs from {\Xic} releases
earlier than 4.0.0, which attempted to automatically read a created
mapping file.  There are two ways to accomplish reading the mapping
file:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The {\cb !kmap} command:  {\vt !kmap} {\it mapfile}\\
This command can be typed into the prompt line and will cause the
named file to be read and the mapping asserted immediately.}

\item{The {\vt ReadKeymap} script function:
  {\vt ReadKeymap(}{\it mapfile\/}{\vt )}\\
The function can be run from any script.  In particular, this line can
be added to a startup script ({\vt .xicstart} or {\vt .xicinit} file)
to assert the mapping when {\Xic} starts.}
\end{enumerate}

In either case, the {\it mapfile} is a path to a file as created with
this command.  If the path is not rooted, the file is searched for
relative to the current directory, the user's home directory, and
through the library search path, in that order.  The commands can be
re-run with different mapping files at any time, the current mapping
state reflects the most recent mapping applied.

\subsection{Key Mapping File}
\index{xic\_keymap file}

The file produced in this manner contains all key mapping and action
translation tables used by {\Xic}.  Although it is not really
recommended, this file can be customized by the user, with a text
editor.  The recommended way to alter a key sequence response is with
a macro (see below), but there may be occasions where the mapping file
should be changed to achieve a desired effect.  Contact Whiteley
Research for assistance.

The name of the file is {\vt xic\_keymap.}{\it hostname}, where {\it
hostname} is the name of the machine.  When {\Xic} starts, it looks
for a file of this name in the current directory, then in the user's
home directory, then in the library search path.  If a file is found,
it is read and processed.

The first section of the mapping file contains a listing of the
keysyms for the special keys mapped with this command ({\kb Home},
{\kb Page Down}, etc.).  The keysym is a system-defined number
assigned to that key.  In Unix/Linux, keysyms are defined in the X
include file {\vt X11/keysymdef.h}.

The next section of the file consists of the definition of the ``macro
suppression'' character (described below).  This must be a printable
ASCII character, surrounded by single quotes.

The third section contains a mapping table for keysyms to an internal
code.  The first column contains the keysyms; a numeric value in
Windows, or the standard name under Unix/Linux.  The second column is
the internal code.  The third column is a subcode used only for
function keys.

The next section contains an action table which maps actions before
the keypress code is sent to any internal command in {\Xic}.  In
action tables, the first column is a code which is either an internal
code, or the ASCII value of the keysym.  This is operating system
dependent.  Under Unix/Linux, the keysym code for a printing character
is simply the ASCII value of that character.  The internal code is
interpreted numerically as a value (hex) 0 -- 1f.  Ascii values are
(hex) 20 -- fe.  Other values are taken as keysyms.  Under Windows, the
code is similar, but the Windows keysym is used.  The Windows keysym
differs in that (1) the upper-case alpha characters must be specified
rather than lower case, (2) for punctuation which is the Shift of a
numeric key, the numeric key should be given, (3) for punctuation
which is not a Shift value for a numeric key, a special keysym for
that key should be given.

The second column is the modifier state.  The actions should be listed
in order of most specific to least specific with regard to modifiers. 
A value ``0'' in this column indicates ``don't care''.  Otherwise, the
entry consists of one or more of ``SHIFT'', ``CTRL'', and ``ALT'',
separated by a minus sign `{\vt -}'.  The actual modifier should be
listed, even if a Shift state is implied by the value in column one.

For example, to select the `!' character, in Unix/Linux one has
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
'!'        SHIFT
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in Windows, this would be
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
'1'        SHIFT
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The third column in the action tables is the name of an action, which
is defined internally in {\Xic}.  This is the action performed when
the keypress combination specified in columns one and two is detected.

The next section in the file is an action table that specifies actions
to perform after the present {\Xic} command processes the keypress. 
Many of the {\Xic} commands look for specific keys, and if that key is
seen, further mapping is inhibited.  If the keypress is not used by
the command, it is available for translation by this final table.

The last section of the file contains a ``{\vt $<$Buttons$>$}'' field
which maps the functions of the mouse buttons under Unix/Linux.  This
allows the functions of the buttons within {\Xic} to be permuted. 
However, the functions of the buttons with respect to the user
interface, such as the mouse button used to engage user interface
buttons and menu items, will not change.  This field is ignored under
Windows.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Define Macro</b> button in the <b>Attributes
    Menu</b> allows the user to enter a macro.  The generated macros
    are stored in a file named <tt>.xicmacros</tt> or
    <tt>.xicmacros.</tt><i>ext</i>, where <i>ext</i> is the current
    technology file extension.  In all cases, when a macro file is
    produced, which occurs after any new macro is defined, the file is
    written in the current directory as <tt>.xicmacros</tt>.  The new
    file contains definitions for all current macros.  The user can
    add the suffix and move the file to their home directory if
    desired.

    <p>
    When <i>Xic</i> starts, it looks for a macro file in the following
    sequence, and inputs the first one (and only one) found:
    <ol>
    <li>current directory using same extension as tech file.
    <li>home directory using same extension as tech file.
    <li>current directory with no extension.
    <li>home directory with no extension.
    </ol>
    Under Windows, the home directory is obtained from environment
    variables, in particular the value of <a
    href="HOME"><b>HOME</b></a>.

    <p>
    Macros can be attached to any combination of a keyboard key and
    modifier key(s), with the exceptions of <b>Enter</b>, <b>Esc</b>,
    <b>Backspace</b>, and the "bare" modifier keys (<b>Shift</b>,
    <b>Ctrl</b>, etc).  However, not all key combinations will work. 
    For example, the expansion of keyboard menu accelerators occurs
    before macro expansion, so menu accelerator key combinations can
    not be used as macros.  Also, key combinations that are
    intercepted by the window manager, which may include some
    combinations involving the <b>Alt</b> key, can not be used as
    macros.  Otherwise, macro definitions have higher priority than
    most other functions in <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    Macros are <i>not</i> expanded when the <a
    href="promptline">prompt line</a> is in text editing mode.  The
    macro expansion can be suppressed for the next key combination by
    pressing the macro suppression character first.  The macro
    suppression character is the backquote (`).  The macro suppression
    character is eliminated from the keypress buffer after the next
    key is typed.  For example, suppose '<tt>o</tt>' is mapped to
    something, but you want to enter a literal '<tt>o</tt>' to trigger
    the <b>Open</b> command ("<tt>op</tt>").  One would type
    "<tt>`op</tt>", after which the keypress buffer would contain
    "<tt>op</tt>" triggering the <b>Open</b> command.

    <p>
    While recording a macro, button and key presses will not have the
    normal effect, but the events are stored in the macro and will
    have the normal effect when the macro is invoked.  Button presses
    will open a menu in the normal way, and selected menu commands
    will become active, but subsequent events will be swallowed by the
    macro recorder.  In most cases, one can send events to a pop-up by
    performing the actions, which won't be carried out but will be
    recorded in the macro.

    <p>
    Note that while recording a macro, if a command is initiated that
    uses the prompt line, the macro string display will be
    overwritten.  It will come back after the first event.  However,
    if the command uses the prompt line for input, the macro
    definition will be terminated as if <b>Esc</b> was entered.

    <p>
    Pressing <b>Enter</b> while a drawing window has the keyboard
    focus terminates the macro definition.  Pressing <b>Esc</b>
    terminates a macro without saving it.  <b>Backspace</b> removes
    the last event when defining a macro.  To enter <b>Esc</b>,
    <b>Backspace</b>, or <b>Enter</b> into the macro, use
    <b>Ctrl-Esc</b>, <b>Ctrl-Backspace</b>, <b>Ctrl-Enter</b>.

    <p>
    For example, suppose we want to define <b>Ctrl-x</b> to "press"
    the <a href="xic:expnd"><b>Expand</b></a> button.  In the
    <b>Define Macro</b> command, press <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>x</b> and
    release.  In response to the next prompt, select the <b>Expand</b>
    button in the <b>View Menu</b>, move the pointer into a drawing
    window, and press the <b>Enter</b> key.  From then on,
    <b>Ctrl-x</b> will be equivalent to pressing the <b>Expand</b>
    button.

    <p>
    To undefine a macro, define it with a null definition for the body.

    <p>
    See the description of the <a href="keybang#bangbang">!! 
    interface</a> for information on using script functions in macros.

    <p>
    In the present GTK-based user interface, there is less need for
    macros due to the rich set of <a href="accelerator">keyboard
    accelerators</a> available.

    <h2>Macro File Format</h2>

    The <tt>.xicmacros</tt> file can contain any number of macro
    definitions.  It is not expected that most users will have a need
    to work with this file directly, though the possibility exists. 
    Each macro consists of a block of lines in the following form:

    <blockquote>
    <tt>#macro</tt><br>
    <tt>KeyDown(... , NULL)</tt><br>
    <i>statements</i><br>
    <tt>#end</tt><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Lines that start with '#' that are not script <a
    href="scr:preproc">preprocessor</a> keywords are taken as
    comments.  The body of the macro consists entirely of calls to
    four script functions:  <a href="KeyDown"><tt>KeyDown</tt></a>, <a
    href="KeyUp"><tt>KeyUp</tt></a>, <a
    href="BtnDown"><tt>BtnDown</tt></a>, and <a
    href="BtnUp"><tt>BtnUp</tt></a>.  The first line must be a
    <tt>KeyDown</tt> command which specifies the character mapped to
    the macro.  The widget string is the value "<tt>NULL</tt>".  The
    remaining lines contain calls to these functions, which simulate
    the button and key presses recorded in the macro.

    <p>
    The events processed while <i>Xic</i> is in use are recorded in
    the <a href="logfiles"><tt>xic_run.log</tt></a> file.  This file
    and other log files are stored in a temporary directory, which is
    deleted when <i>Xic</i> terminates normally.  To access the
    <tt>xic_run.log</tt> file from <i>Xic</i>, press the <a
    href="xic:logs"><b>Log Files</b></a> button in the <b>Help
    Menu</b>, then select the <tt>xic_run.log</tt> entry in the
    resulting file selector, then press the green octagon on the file
    selector.  Advanced users can cut/paste sequences of the commands
    into script files or macros.
!!LATEX xic:macro attrmenu.tex
Pressing the {\cb Define Macro} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu}
allows the user to enter a macro.  The generated macros are stored in
a file named {\vt .xicmacros} or {\vt .xicmacros}.{\it ext}, where
{\it ext} is the current technology file extension.  In all cases,
when a macro file is produced, which occurs after any new macro is
defined, the file is written in the current directory as {\vt
.xicmacros}.  The new file contains definitions for all current
macros.  The user can add the suffix and move the file to their home
directory if desired.

When {\Xic} starts, it looks for a macro file in the following
sequence, and inputs the first one (and only one) found:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}\\
1. &  current directory using same extension as tech file.\\
2. &  home directory using same extension as tech file.\\
3. &  current directory with no extension.\\
4. &  home directory with no extension.
\end{tabular}

Under Windows, the home directory is obtained from environment
variables, in particular the value of {\et HOME}.

Macros can be attached to any combination of a keyboard key and
modifier key(s), with the exceptions of {\kb Enter}, {\kb Esc}, {\kb
Backspace}, and the ``bare'' modifier keys ({\kb Shift}, {\kb Ctrl},
etc).  However, not all key combinations will work.  For example, the
expansion of keyboard menu accelerators occurs before macro expansion,
so menu accelerator key combinations can not be used as macros.  Also,
key combinations that are intercepted by the window manager, which may
include some combinations involving the {\kb Alt} key, can not be used
as macros.  Otherwise, macro definitions have higher priority than
most other functions in {\Xic}.

Macros are {\it not} expanded when the prompt line is in text editing
mode.  The macro expansion can be suppressed for the next key
combination by pressing the macro suppression character first.  The
macro suppression character is the backquote ({\vt `}).  The macro
suppression character is eliminated from the keypress buffer after the
next key is typed.  For example, suppose `{\vt o}' is mapped to
something, but you want to enter a literal `{\vt o}' to trigger the
{\cb Open} command (``{\vt op}'').  One would type ``{\vt `op}'',
after which the keypress buffer would contain ``{\vt op}'' triggering
the {\cb Open} command.

While recording a macro, button and key presses will not have the
normal effect, but the events are stored in the macro and will have
the normal effect when the macro is invoked.  Button presses will open
a menu in the normal way, and selected menu commands will become
active, but subsequent events will be swallowed by the macro recorder. 
In most cases, one can send events to a pop-up by performing the
actions, which won't be carried out but will be recorded in the macro.

Note that while recording a macro, if a command is initiated that uses
the prompt line, the macro string display will be overwritten.  It
will come back after the first event.  However, if the command uses
the prompt line for input, the macro definition will be terminated as
if {\kb Esc} was entered.

Pressing {\kb Enter} while a drawing window has the keyboard focus
terminates the macro definition.  Pressing {\kb Esc} terminates a
macro without saving it.  {\kb Backspace} removes the last event when
defining a macro.  To enter {\kb Esc}, {\kb Backspace}, or {\kb Enter}
into the macro, use {\kb Ctrl-Esc}, {\kb Ctrl-Backspace}, {\kb
Ctrl-Enter}.

For example, Suppose we want to define {\kb Ctrl-x} to ``press'' the
{\cb Expand} button.  In the {\cb Define Macro} command, press {\kb
Ctrl} and {\kb x} and release.  In response to the next prompt, select
the {\kb Expand} button in the {\cb View Menu}, move the pointer into
a drawing window, and press the {\kb Enter} key.  From then on, {\kb
Ctrl-x} will be equivalent to pressing the {\kb Expand} button.

To undefine a macro, define it with a null definition for the body.

See the description of the ``!!'' interface in Chapt.  \ref{bangcmds}
for information on using script functions in macros.

In the present GTK-based user interface, there is less need for
macros due to the rich set of keyboard accelerators available.

\subsection{Macro File Format}
\index{.xicmacros file format}
The {\vt .xicmacros} file can contain any number of macro definitions. 
It is not expected that most users will have a need to work with this
file directly, though the possibility exists.  Each macro consists of
a block of lines in the following form:
\begin{quote}
{\vt \#macro}\\
{\vt KeyDown(... , NULL)}\\
{\it statements}\\
{\vt \#end}
\end{quote}

Lines that start with `{\vt \#}' that are not script preprocessor
keywords (see \ref{preproc}) are taken as comments.  The body of the
macro consists entirely of calls to four script functions {\vt
KeyDown}, {\vt KeyUp}, {\vt BtnDown}, and {\vt BtnUp}.  The first line
must be a {\vt KeyDown} command which specifies the character mapped
to the macro.  The widget string is the value ``{\vt NULL}''.  The
remaining lines contain calls to these functions, which simulate the
button and key presses recorded in the macro.

The events processed while {\Xic} is in use are recorded in the {\vt
xic\_run.log} file (see \ref{logfiles}).  This file and other log
files are stored in a temporary directory, which is deleted when
{\Xic} terminates normally.  To access the {\vt xic\_run.log} file
from {\Xic}, press the {\cb Log Files} button in the {\cb Help Menu},
then select the {\vt xic\_run.log} entry in the resulting file
selector, then press the green octagon on the file selector.  Advanced
users can cut/paste sequences of the commands into script files or
macros.

    The <b>Set Attributes</b> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Window Attributes</b> panel.  The panel contains
    controls which affect presentation attributes in all drawing
    windows.  The panel contains five tabbed pages:  <b>General</b>,
    <b>Selections</b>, <b>Phys Props</b>, <b>Terminals</b>, and
    <b>Labels</b>

    <p>
    The controls found is the <b>General</b> page are as follows.
    This is the default page shown when the panel first appears.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Cursor</b><dd>
    This menu provides a choice of cursors.  These include the system
    default cursor (which is probably the same as the left arrow),
    cross cursor, left and right arrows.  Under Windows, there is no
    right arrow, so an up arrow is used instead (but it is ugly and
    useless).  Also, the default cross cursor for Windows 7 service
    pack 1 is huge and grotesque, but can be switched for a better
    looking cross cursor through the selections in the Windows
    <b>System Preferences</b> panel.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Use full-window cursor</b><dd>
    When this check box is checked, the mouse cursor will be
    represented by horizontal and vertical lines which extend across
    the entire width and height of the drawing window containing the
    cursor.  The lines intersect at the nearest snap point in the
    current window. 

    <p>
    When not checked, the cursor is the normal small cross.

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the <a
    href="FullWinCursor"><b>FullWinCursor</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Subcell visibility threshold (pixels)</b><dd>
    This entry area specifies a pixel size threshold for display of
    expanded subcells.  Subcells with height or width less than this
    threshold will not be displayed, or displayed as an unfilled
    bounding box, according to the setting of the <a
    href="xic:tinyb"><b>Subthreshold Boxes</b></a> menu button in the
    <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of the <b>Attributes Menu</b>, and the
    <b>Attributes</b> menu of sub-windows.  The value can be in the
    range 0-100.  If 0, subcells will always be rendered when in
    expanded state, which can greatly increase drawing time when
    zoomed out.  This setting applies to all drawing windows. 

    <p>
    This entry tracks the setting of the <a
    href="CellThreshold"><b>CellThreshold</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Push context display illumination percent</b><dd>
    When the <a href="xic:push"><b>Push</b></a> command is active, and
    the "context" (the features surrounding the pushed-to subcell) is
    being displayed, the intensity of colors used to render the
    context is reduced.  This visually differentiates objects in the
    current cell from those in the context.  The percentage intensity
    of the context can be set from this input area.  If set to 100,
    the context is rendered with the same coloring as the current
    cell.

    <p>
    This entry tracks the setting of the <a
    href="ContextDarkPcnt"><b>ContextDarkPcnt</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Pixels between pop-ups and prompt line</b><dd>
    For windows that are automatically placed just above the prompt
    line, giving this entry a positive integer value will position these
    windows toward the top of the screen by that many pixels.  This is
    useful when using "plasma" displays (such as Mac or KDE), where
    the shadow falls on the prompt line, which can be distracting.  It
    might also be helpful if the window positioning is incorrect,
    which might occur with some window managers.

    The <b>Selections</b> page contains the following two
    check boxes.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Show origin of selected physical instances</b><dd>
    When this check box is set, selected physical instances will have
    the cell origin marked with a cross.  This applies to the
    selection highlighting, as well as to the ghost rendition which is
    attached to the mouse pointer during a <a href="xic:move">move</a>
    or <a href="xic:copy">copy</a> operation.

    <p>
    Showing the origin may seem trivial, but marking the origin
    requires a bit of overhead since it requires running a
    transformation and keeping track of an additional redisplay area
    since the origin may be outside of the cell bounding box.  Thus,
    the default is to not show the mark.

    <p>
    This tracks the state of the <a
    href="MarkInstanceOrigin"><b>MarkInstanceOrigin</b></a> variable,
    and applies to all physical drawing windows.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Show centroids of selected physical objects</b><dd>
    In mathematics, the centroid or geometric center of a
    two-dimensional region is the arithmetic mean of all the points in
    the shape.  When this check box is set, selected objects will mark
    the centroid with a cross.  This applies to the selection
    highlighting, as well as to the ghost rendition which is attached
    to the mouse pointer during a <a href="xic:move">move</a> or <a
    href="xic:copy">copy</a> operation.

    <p>

    This will cause the area under terminals in physical windows to be
    erased, to promote visibility.  One can choose to not erase, to
    erase only under the cell's terminals, or to erase under all
    terminals.  This tracks the setting of the <a

    <dt><b>Hidden label scope</b><dd>
    By default, all labels participate in a protocol whereby clicking
    on the label with the <b>Shift</b> key held will "hide" the label,
    displaying a small box instead.  <b>Shift</b>-clicking on the
    box will return to the display of the label text.  This menu
    limits the labels which will participate in this protocol.  The
    choices are <b>all labels</b> the default, <b>all electrical
    labels</b>, <b>electrical property labels</b>, and <b>no

    This menu tracks the setting of the <a
    href="LabelHiddenMode"><b>LabelHiddenMode</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Default minimum label height</b><dd>
    This sets the minimum label height, in microns, for new text
    labels.  The actual initial height may be larger, depending on the
    zoom factor of the window, but it can not be smaller.

    This tracks the setting of the <a
    href="LabelDefHeight"><b>LabelDefHeight</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Maximum displayed label length</b><dd>
    This entry sets the maximum width, in default-sized character
    cells, of a displayed <a href="xic:label#maxlen">label</a>.  If
    the label exceeds this width, it is not shown, and a small box at
    the text origin is shown instead.  The default is 256.

    <p>
    The "hidden" status of a property label can be toggled by clicking
    the text or box with button 1 with the <b>Shift</b> key held.

    This entry tracks the setting of the <a
    href="LabelMaxLen"><b>LabelMaxLen</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Label optional displayed line limit</b><dd>
    Label text strings may have embedded newline characters which
    cause them to be displayed on multiple lines.  This setting, when
    set to a positive integer value, provides a limit on the number of
    lines that are actually displayed, in labels that respect this
    limit.  Only the first <i>N</i> lines would actually appear in the
    display, where <i>N</i> is the given number.  If <i>N</i> is
    zero, there is no limit.

    <p>
    Labels observe this limit only if an internal flag is set in the
    label.  Presently, this is set internally for the labels
    associated with <a href="prpty:value"><b>value</b></a> and <a
    href="prpty:param"><b>param</b></a> properties.  The user can
    apply the limit to any label by setting the <tt>LIML</tt> flag in
    the <a href="XprpXform"><tt>XprpXform</tt></a> pseudo-property.

The {\cb Set Attributes} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu} brings up
the {\cb Window Attributes} panel.  The panel contains controls which
affect presentation attributes in all drawing windows.  The panel
contains five tabbed pages:  {\cb General}, {\cb Selections}, {\cb
Phys Props}, {\cb Terminals}, and {\cb Labels}

The controls found in the {\cb General} page are as follows.

\begin{description}

\index{Set Cursor button}
\index{cursor mode}
\item{\cb Cursor}\\
This menu provides a choice of cursors.  These include the system
default cursor (which is probably the same as the left arrow), cross
cursor, left and right arrows.  Under Windows, there is no right
arrow, so an up arrow is used instead (but it is ugly and useless). 
Also, the default cross cursor for Windows 7 service pack 1 is huge
and grotesque, but can be switched for a better looking cross cursor
through the selections in the Windows {\cb System Preferences}
panel.

\item{\cb Use full-window cursor}\\
When this check box is checked, the mouse cursor will be represented
by horizontal and vertical lines which extend across the entire width
and height of the drawing window containing the cursor.  The lines
intersect at the nearest snap point in the current window.
    
When not checked, the cursor is the normal small cross.

This tracks the state of the {\et FullWinCursor} variable.

\item{\cb Subcell visibility threshold (pixels)}\\
This entry area specifies a pixel size threshold for display of
expanded subcells.  Subcells with height or width less than this
threshold will not be displayed, or displayed as an unfilled bounding
box, according to the setting of the {\cb Subthreshold Boxes} menu
button in the {\cb Main Window} sub-menu of the {\cb Attributes Menu},
and the {\cb Attributes} menu of sub-windows.  The value can be in the
range 0--100.  If 0, subcells will always be rendered when in expanded
state, which can greatly increase drawing time when zoomed out.  This
setting applies to all drawing windows.

This entry tracks the setting of the {\et CellThreshold} variable.

\item{\cb Push context display illumination percent}\\
When the {\cb Push} command is active, and the ``context'' (the
features surrounding the pushed-to subcell) is being displayed, the
intensity of colors used to render the context is reduced.  This
visually differentiates objects in the current cell from those in the
context.  The percentage intensity of the context can be set from this
input area.  If set to 100, the context is rendered with the same
coloring as the current cell.

This entry tracks the setting of the {\et ContextDarkPcnt} variable.

\item{\cb Pixels between pop-ups and prompt line}\\
For windows that are automatically placed just above the prompt line,
giving this entry a positive integer value will position these windows
toward the top of the screen by that many pixels.  This is useful when
using ``plasma'' displays (such as Mac or KDE), where the shadow falls
on the prompt line, which can be distracting.  It might also be
helpful if the window positioning is incorrect, which might occur with
some window managers.

This tracks the state of the {\et LowerWinOffset} Variable.

The {\cb Selections} page contains the following two check boxes.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Show origin of selected physical instances}\\
When this check box is set, selected physical instances will have the cell
origin marked with a cross.  This applies to the selection
highlighting, as well as to the ghost rendition which is attached to
the mouse pointer during a move or copy operation.

Showing the origin may seem trivial, but marking the origin requires a
bit of overhead since it requires running a transformation and keeping
track of an additional redisplay area since the origin may be outside
of the cell bounding box.  Thus, the default is to not show the mark.

This tracks the state of the {\et MarkInstanceOrigin} variable, and
applies to all physical drawing windows.

\item{\cb Show centroids of selected physical objects}\\
In mathematics, the centroid or geometric center of a two-dimensional
region is the arithmetic mean of all the points in the shape.  When
this check box is set, selected objects will mark the centroid with a
cross.  This applies to the selection highlighting, as well as to the
ghost rendition which is attached to the mouse pointer during a move
or copy operation.

This tracks the state of the {\et MarkObjectCentroid} variable, and
applies to all physical drawing windows.
\end{description}

The {\cb Phys Props} page contains the following controls.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Erase behind physical properties text}\\
When this check box is set, in windows where physical properties are
being displayed, the area around the physical property text is erased,
providing improved visibility.

This tracks the state of the {\et EraseBehindProps} variable.

\item{\cb Physical property text size (pixels)}\\
This entry sets the height, in pixels, of the text used to render
physical properties on-screen, when physical property text is being
displayed.

This tracks the state of the {\et PhysPropTextSize} variable.
\end{description}

The {\cb Terminals} page contains the following controls.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Erase behind physical terminals}\\
This will cause the area under terminals in physical windows to be
erased, to promote visibility.  One can choose to not erase, to erase
only under the cell's terminals, or to erase under all terminals. 
This tracks the setting of the {\et EraseBehindTerms} variable.

\item{\cb Terminal text pixel size}\\
This sets the text height, in pixels, of the text associated with
terminals in both physical and electrical windows.  This tracks the
setting of the {\et TermTextSize} variable.  The default text height
is 14 pixels.

\item{\cb Terminal mark size}\\
This sets the pixel size of the mark used to indicate terminal
locations in both physical and electrical windows.  It tracks the
value of the {\et TermMarkSize} variable.  The default mark size is 10
pixels.
\end{description}

Finally, the {\cb Labels} page contains controls related to label
presentation.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Hidden label scope}\\
By default, all labels participate in a protocol whereby clicking on
the label with the {\kb Shift} key held will ``hide'' the label,
displaying a small box instead.  {\kb Shift}-clicking on the box will
return to the display of the label text.  This menu limits the labels
which will participate in this protocol.  The choices are {\cb all
labels} (the default), {\cb all electrical labels}, {\cb electrical
property labels}, and {\cb no labels}.

This menu tracks the setting of the {\et LabelHiddenMode} variable.

\item{\cb Default minimum label height}\\
This sets the minimum label height, in microns, for new text labels. 
The actual initial height may be larger, depending on the zoom factor
of the window, but it can not be smaller. 

This tracks the setting of the {\et LabelDefHeight} variable.

\item{\cb Maximum displayed label length}\\
This entry sets the maximum width, in default-sized character cells,
of a displayed label.  If the label exceeds this width,
it is not shown, and a small box at the text origin is shown instead. 
The default is 256.

The ``hidden'' status of a property label can be toggled by clicking
the text or box with button 1 with the {\kb Shift} key held.
See \ref{labelbut} for more information.

This entry tracks the setting of the {\et LabelMaxLen} variable.

\item{\cb Label optional displayed line limit}\\
Label text strings may have embedded newline characters which cause
them to be displayed on multiple lines.  This setting, when set to a
positive integer value, provides a limit on the number of lines that
are actually displayed, in labels that respect this limit.  Only the
first {\it N} lines would actually appear in the display, where {\it
N} is the given number.  If {\it N} is zero, there is no limit.
 
Labels observe this limit only if an internal flag is set in the
label.  Presently, this is set internally for the labels associated
with {\et value} and {\et param} properties.  The user can apply the
limit to any label by setting the {\vt LIML} flag in the {\vt
XprpXform} pseudo-property.
 
The setting tracks the value of the {\et LabelMaxLines} variable.

    terminals or wire vertices.  This selection is the default.

    <p>
    A dot will also be shown if a cell connection point lies on an

    <p>
    Although many of the fonts used in the graphical interface can be

    table</a> or <a href="xic:lpal">layer palette</a> with <a
    href="button3">button 3</a> while holding down the <b>Shift</b>
    key.  The current layer will become the clicked-on layer, and its
    fill pattern will be loaded into the editor.

    <p>
    This panel initially displays an array of sample fill patterns. 
    By pressing the <b>Pixel Editor</b> button, the pop-up will
    instead display a large pixel editor window, from which stipple
    patterns can be created and modified.  The pixel editor is
    pre-loaded with the pattern of the current layer when the pop-up
    was invoked.  When viewing the pixel editor, the <b>Show
    Stores</b> button reverts the display to the sample patterns.

    <p>
    Patterns are moved between the various boxes and layers in the
    layer table by drag/drop.  Press and hold the left mouse button
    while the pointer is over the box or layer entry that is the
    source of a pattern, and release the button after moving the mouse
    pointer over the destination box or layer table entry.

    <p>
    There are also <b>Load</b> and <b>Apply</b> buttons that will load
    the pattern of the current layer into the editor, or set the
    pattern of the current layer from the <b>Sample</b>, respectively.

    <p>
    The <b>Sample</b> box, which is visible in both display modes, is
    the entry and exit point for the pixel editor.  Dropping a pattern
    into the <b>Sample</b> area will load the pattern into the editor. 
    The current pattern in the <b>Sample</b> area, which matches that
    currently in the editor, can be dragged and dropped onto a layer,
    or into one of the storage areas.  When the <b>Pixel Editor</b>
    window is visible, it is also a drop receiver, equivalent to the
    <b>Sample</b> area.

    <p>
    When a pattern is applied to a layer by any means, the main window
    and any sub-windows showing the same display mode will be redrawn.
    The automatic redraw can be suppressed in physical mode by setting
    the <a href="NoPhysRedraw"><b>NoPhysRedraw</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    When displaying the pattern array, there are 18 pattern windows
    visible.  The first two of these are immutable, containing empty
    and solid fills.  The remaining 16 are registers, preset with
    default patterns.  These patterns can be changed by dropping a new
    pattern into the display box.

    <p>
    There are 64 pattern registers available, in four pages.  When the
    patterns are visible, the <b>Page</b> spin button can be used to
    cycle between the four sets of registers.

    <p>
    To summarize, the following transfers are possible with drag/drop:
    <ul>
    <li>To the <b>Sample</b> box from any pattern register box, or the
    empty and solid boxes, or from any layer in the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a> or <a href="xic:ltpal">layer
    palette</a>.  Drag patterns into the <b>Sample</b> area to allow
    editing with the pixel editor.  The <b>Pixel Editor</b> window is
    also a drop receiver equivalent to the <b>Sample</b> area.

    <p>
    <li>From the <b>Sample</b> box to any pattern register box, or to
    any layer in the layer table or layer palette.  Drag patterns into
    layers to set the pattern used for that layer.  A pattern dragged
    into a pattern register box will replace the existing pattern with
    the one from the source.

    <p>
    <li>From any pattern register box, or the solid and empty fill
    boxes, to any layer in the layer table or layer palette, or to the
    <b>Sample</b> box.

    <p>
    <li>To any pattern register box, from any layer from the layer
    table or layer palette, or the <b>Sample</b> box.  Note that it is
    not possible to drag/drop patterns between pattern register boxes
    directly, one can drag from a register to the <b>Sample</b> box,
    then from the <b>Sample</b> box to another register box.

    <p>
    <li>From any layer in the layer table or layer palette to any of
    the default pattern boxes except solid and empty, or to the
    <b>Sample</b> box.

    <p>
    <li>To any layer in the layer table or layer palette, from any of
    the pattern register boxes, or the solid and empty boxes, or the
    <b>Sample</b> box.
    </ul>

    <p>
    If the <b>Print Control</b> panel (induced by the <a
    href="xic:hcopy"><b>Print</b></a> button in the <b>File Menu</b>)
    is visible, when a new fill pattern is applied to a layer, the new
    fill pattern will be used for rendering the plot, if the plot
    driver supports definable fill patterns.

    <p>
    Note that the new pattern set for a layer will not be visible in
    the drawing windows until they are next redrawn (press
    <b>Ctrl-r</b>, or click with button 2 near the center of the
    window to redraw the window).

    <p>
    The color used to display patterns in the pop-up is the color of
    the current layer.  Initiating a drag from a layer in the layer
    table or layer palette will change the current layer (and hence
    the color) to that layer.

    <p>
    The 64 "default" fill patterns can be saved in an
    <tt>xic_stipples</tt> file in the current directory with the
    <b>Dump Defs</b> button, which is visible when the pattern array
    is being displayed.  If this file is found in the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>, it will be used to initialize the
    pattern registers when <i>Xic</i> starts.  A system default
    <tt>xic_stipples</tt> file is provided in the startup directory.

    <p>
    When a pattern (including empty) is dropped on a layer, the
    <b>Outline</b>, <b>Fat</b>, and <b>Cut</b> buttons at the bottom
    of the pop-up set additional attributes relating to the pattern
    display.

    <p>
    When a pattern from a layer is dropped into the <b>Sample</b> box,
    the buttons will change state to that saved in the layer.  The
    pattern registers, however, do not have attributes, so that the
    buttons remain unchanged when a pattern is dragged from a register
    box, except to gray the <b>Fat</b> button if the new pattern is
    not empty.

    <p>
    For empty fill, there are three available outline styles:
    <ol>
    <li>A thin solid line boundary.
    <li>A thin dashed line boundary.
    <li>A thick solid line boundary for Manhattan boxes and polygons,
    and a thin solid line boundary for other objects.
    </ol>

    <p>
    If the <b>Outline</b> button is not in the pressed state, the thin
    solid line boundary (style 1) will be used.  If <b>Outline</b> is
    in the pressed state, and <b>Fat</b> is not in the pressed state,
    a thin dashed outline (style 2) will be used.  If <b>Fat</b> is
    pressed, thick segments (style 3) will be used, but only for edges
    of boxes and Manhattan polygons.  A thin solid outline will be
    used elsewhere.

    <p>
    If the <b>Cut</b> button is in the pressed state, boxes are
    rendered with thin lines along the diagonals, forming an X over
    the box.  Polygons (even four-sided rectangular ones) and wires
    are drawn normally.  The "cut" attribute is often used to signify
    vias.

    <p>
    If <b>Cut</b> and <b>Outline</b> are pressed with empty fill, but
    <b>Fat</b> is not pressed, the diagonal "cut" lines will be drawn
    as dashed, as for the outline.

    <p>
    When the pattern is not empty, the options are slightly different. 
    If <b>Outline</b> is not pressed, objects will not be outlined. 
    If <b>Outline</b> is pressed and <b>Fat</b> is not pressed, the
    patterned areas will have a thin solid outline.  When <b>Fat</b>
    is pressed, boxes and Manhattan polygons will be shown with thick
    outlines.  These are the only boundaries available with stippled
    fill.  The <b>Cut</b> button will produce diagonals over boxes, as
    in the empty-fill case.  If the pattern is solid, none of the
    attributes will be used, and the buttons are grayed.

    <p>
    When a pattern is dropped on a layer, the state of these buttons
    set the attributes for the layer.  This applies whether the
    pattern source is the <b>Sample</b> box, or one of the pattern
    register boxes.  In particular, to set up a desired empty-fill
    presentation for a layer, one would set the buttons, then drag the
    "pattern" from the empty-fill box to the layer to set.

    <p>
    In the pixel editor, the <b>NX x NY</b> spin buttons control the
    size of the map.  Each coordinate can range from 2 to 32.  The
    pixel editor window changes to accommodate the different aspect
    ratios, keeping the actual pixels square.

    <p>
    The three buttons just below operate on the pixel map.
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Rot90</b><dd>
    Pressing this button will rotate the pixel map by 90 degrees.  Note that
    this swaps the Nx and Ny values.
    </dl>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>X</b><dd>
    This will flip the map right-to-left (mirroring about the Y axis).
    </dl>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Y</b><dd>
    This will flip the map top-to-bottom (mirroring about the X axis).
    </dl>
    
    <p>
    The basic operation in the pixel editor is to toggle the state of
    a pixel by clicking on it with button 1, but more complex
    possibilities exist.  A hold and drag will operate on all of the
    pixels enclosed in or intersecting the defined rectangle, which is
    ghost-drawn.  The operations are indicated in the table below.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Button</th> <th>Figure</th> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th>Shift</th>
     <th>Ctrl</th>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>solid box</td> <td>toggle</td> <td>set</td>
     <td>unset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td>open box</td> <td>toggle</td> <td>set</td>
     <td>unset</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td> <td>line</td> <td>toggle</td> <td>set</td>
     <td>unset</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    If <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b> is held down <i>before</i> button 1
    is pressed, the action will be as for button 2.  The three columns
    from the right indicate the state of the modifier keys on button
    release which produces the stated effect on the pixels.  The
    <b>Ctrl</b> press overrides <b>Shift</b> if both are pressed.

    <p>
    Pressing the arrow keys while the pop-up has the keyboard focus
    permutes the pixel editor bitmap in the opposite direction of the
    arrow.  This is valuable for allowing layers with similar patterns
    to show through one another.

    <p>
    Pressing the <b>Dismiss</b> button in the <b>Fill Pattern
    Editor</b> will retire the editor.  This has the same effect as
    pressing the <b>Set Fill</b> menu button a second time.
!!LATEX xic:fill sttrimenu.tex
The {\cb Set Fill} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu} brings up the
{\cb Fill Pattern Editor} panel.  The panel can also be displayed by
clicking on a layer in the layer table or layer palette with button 3
while holding down the {\kb Shift} key.  The current layer will become
the clicked-on layer, and its fill pattern will be loaded into the
editor.

This panel initially displays an array of sample fill patterns.  By
pressing the {\cb Pixel Editor} button, the pop-up will instead
display a large pixel editor window, from which stipple patterns can
be created and modified.  The pixel editor is pre-loaded with the
pattern of the current layer when the pop-up was invoked.  When
viewing the pixel editor, the {\cb Show Stores} button reverts the
display to the sample patterns.

Patterns are moved between the various boxes and layers in the layer
table by drag/drop.  Press and hold the left mouse button while the
pointer is over the box or layer entry that is the source of a
pattern, and release the button after moving the mouse pointer over
the destination box or layer table entry.

There are also {\cb Load} and {\cb Apply} buttons that will load the
pattern of the current layer into the editor, or set the pattern of
the current layer from the {\cb Sample}, respectively.

The {\cb Sample} box, which is visible in both display modes, is the
entry and exit point for the pixel editor.  Dropping a pattern into
the {\cb Sample} area will load the pattern into the editor.  The
current pattern in the {\cb Sample} area, which matches that currently
in the editor, can be dragged and dropped onto a layer, or into one of
the storage areas.  When the {\cb Pixel Editor} window is visible, it
is also a drop receiver, equivalent to the {\cb Sample} area.

When a pattern is applied to a layer by any means, the main window and
any sub-windows showing the same display mode will be redrawn.  The
automatic redraw can be suppressed in physical mode by setting the
{\cb NoPhysRedraw} variable.

When displaying the pattern array, there are 18 pattern windows
visible.  The first two of these are immutable, containing empty and
solid fills.  The remaining 16 are registers, preset with default
patterns.  These patterns can be changed by dropping a new pattern
into the display box.

There are 64 pattern registers available, in four pages.  When the
patterns are visible, the {\cb Page} spin button can be used to cycle
between the four sets of registers.

To summarize, the following transfers are possible with drag/drop:
\begin{itemize}
\item{To the {\cb Sample} box from any pattern register box, or the
empty and solid boxes, or from any layer in the layer table or layer
palette.  Drag patterns into the {\cb Sample} area to allow editing
with the pixel editor.  The {\cb Pixel Editor} window is also a drop
receiver equivalent to the {\cb Sample} area.}

\item{From the {\cb Sample} box to any pattern register box, or to
any layer in the layer table or layer palette.  Drag patterns into
layers to set the pattern used for that layer.  A pattern dragged
into a pattern register box will replace the existing pattern with
the one from the source.}

\item{From any pattern register box, or the solid and empty fill
boxes, to any layer in the layer table or layer palette, or to the
{\cb Sample} box.}

\item{To any pattern register box, from any layer from the layer table
or layer palette, or the {\cb Sample} box.  Note that it is not
possible to drag/drop patterns between pattern register boxes
directly, one can drag from a register to the {\cb Sample} box, then
from the {\cb Sample} box to another register box.}

\item{From any layer in the layer table or layer palette to any of
the default pattern boxes except solid and empty, or to the
{\cb Sample} box.}

\item{To any layer in the layer table or layer palette, from any of
the pattern register boxes, or the solid and empty boxes, or the {\cb
Sample} box.}
\end{itemize}

If the {\cb Print Control} panel (induced by the {\cb Print} button in
the {\cb File Menu}) is visible, when a new fill pattern is applied to
a layer, the new fill pattern will be used for rendering the plot, if
the plot driver supports definable fill patterns.

Note that the new pattern set for a layer will not be visible in the
drawing windows until they are next redrawn (press {\kb Ctrl-r}, or
click with button 2 near the center of the window to redraw the
window).

The color used to display patterns in the pop-up is the color of the
current layer.  Initiating a drag from a layer in the layer table or
layer palette will change the current layer (and hence the color) to
that layer.

The 64 ``default'' fill patterns can be saved in an {\vt xic\_stipples}
file in the current directory with the {\cb Dump Defs} button, which
is visible when the pattern array is being displayed.  If this file is
found in the library search path, it will be used to initialize the
pattern registers when {\Xic} starts.  A system default {\vt
xic\_stipples} file is provided in the startup directory.

When a pattern (including empty) is dropped on a layer, the {\cb
Outline}, {\cb Fat}, and {\cb Cut} buttons at the bottom of the pop-up
set additional attributes relating to the pattern display.

When a pattern from a layer is dropped into the {\cb Sample} box, the
buttons will change state to that saved in the layer.  The pattern
registers, however, do not have attributes, so that the buttons remain
unchanged when a pattern is dragged from a register box, except to
gray the {\cb Fat} button if the new pattern is not empty.

For empty fill, there are three available outline styles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{A thin solid line boundary.}
\item{A thin dashed line boundary.}
\item{A thick solid line boundary for Manhattan boxes and polygons,
and a thin solid line boundary for other objects.}
\end{enumerate}

If the {\cb Outline} button is not in the pressed state, the thin
solid line boundary (style 1) will be used.  If {\cb Outline} is in
the pressed state, and {\cb Fat} is not in the pressed state, a thin
dashed outline (style 2) will be used.  If {\cb Fat} is pressed, thick
segments (style 3) will be used, but only for edges of boxes and
Manhattan polygons.  A thin solid outline will be used elsewhere.

If the {\cb Cut} button is in the pressed state, boxes are rendered
with thin lines along the diagonals, forming an X over the box. 
Polygons (even four-sided rectangular ones) and wires are drawn
normally.  The ``cut'' attribute is often used to signify vias.

If {\cb Cut} and {\cb Outline} are pressed with empty fill, but {\cb
Fat} is not pressed, the diagonal ``cut'' lines will be drawn as
dashed, as for the outline.

When the pattern is not empty, the options are slightly different.  If
{\cb Outline} is not pressed, objects will not be outlined.  If {\cb
Outline} is pressed and {\cb Fat} is not pressed, the patterned areas
will have a thin solid outline.  When {\cb Fat} is pressed, boxes and
Manhattan polygons will be shown with thick outlines.  These are the
only boundaries available with stippled fill.  The {\cb Cut} button
will produce diagonals over boxes, as in the empty-fill case.  If the
pattern is solid, none of the attributes will be used, and the buttons
are grayed.

When a pattern is dropped on a layer, the state of these buttons set
the attributes for the layer.  This applies whether the pattern source
is the {\cb Sample} box, or one of the pattern register boxes.  In
particular, to set up a desired empty-fill presentation for a layer,
one would set the buttons, then drag the ``pattern'' from the
empty-fill box to the layer to set.

In the pixel editor, the {\cb NX x NY} spin buttons control the size
of the map.  Each coordinate can range from 2 to 32.  The pixel editor
window changes to accommodate the different aspect ratios, keeping the
actual pixels square.

The three buttons just below operate on the pixel map.
\begin{description}
\item{\cb Rot90}\\
Pressing this button will rotate the pixel map by 90 degrees.  Note that
this swaps the Nx and Ny values.

\item{\cb X}\\
This will flip the map right-to-left (mirroring about the Y axis).

\item{\cb Y}\\
This will flip the map top-to-bottom (mirroring about the X axis).
\end{description}

The basic operation in the pixel editor is to toggle the state of a
pixel by clicking on it with button 1, but more complex possibilities
exist.  A hold and drag will operate on all of the pixels enclosed in
or intersecting the defined rectangle, which is ghost-drawn.  The
operations are indicated in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline
\bf Button & \bf Figure & & \bf Shift & \bf Ctrl\\ \hline
1 & solid box & toggle & set & unset\\ \hline
2 & open box & toggle & set & unset\\ \hline
3 & line & toggle & set & unset\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

If {\kb Shift} or {\kb Ctrl} is held down {\it before} button 1 is
pressed, the action will be as for button 2.  The three columns from
the right indicate the state of the modifier keys on button release
which produces the stated effect on the pixels.  The {\kb Ctrl} press
overrides {\kb Shift} if both are pressed.

Pressing the arrow keys while the pop-up has the keyboard focus
permutes the pixel editor bitmap in the opposite direction of the
arrow.  This is valuable for allowing layers with similar patterns to
show through one another.

Pressing the {\cb Dismiss} button in the {\cb Fill Pattern Editor}
will retire the editor.  This has the same effect as pressing the {\cb
Set Fill} menu button a second time.

    The <b>Edit Tech Params</b> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>
    brings up the <b>Tech Parameter Editor</b>.  The editor can also
    be displayed by clicking on a layer in the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a> or <a href="xic:lpal">layer
    palette</a> with <a href="button3">button 3</a> while holding down

    for the editor.

    <p>
    From the editor, many of the technology file keywords, mostly
    associated with layers, can have their specifications added,
    deleted, or edited.  Keywords that are not adjustable in the
    editor have an alternate means of control, such as the separate
    panels for setting layer <a href="xic:color">colors</a> and <a
    href="xic:fill">fill patterns</a>.  After modification, the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes
    Menu</b> can be used to generate a new technology file that
    incorporates the changes.

    <p>
    The present editor applies to all keywords.  In earlier <i>Xic</i>
    releases, there were separate keyword editors in the
    <b>Extract</b> and <b>Convert</b> menus, as well as an editor in
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  The different keyword classes,
    previously available in separate editors, are now available by
    selecting one of the four tabs at the top of the editor window. 
    Each of these keywords is normally applied to a <a
    href="techfile:layers">layer</a> in the <a
    href="techfile">technology file</a>.

    <p>
    The editor is configured for the class of keywords selected,
    meaning that the pull-down menu contains entries for those

    The editor is similar to the <a href="xic:dredt"><b>Design Rule
    Editor</b></a> found in the <b>DRC Menu</b>.  When the editor
    first appears, the keyword specifications for the current layer in
    the selected class are listed.  The specifications appear as they
    would in the <a href="techfile:layers">technology file</a>. 
    Changing the current layer will update the listing to the
    parameters for the new current layer.  Selecting a different
    keyword class will update the display to show the keywords in the
    selected class.  The user can add new keyword lines or modify
    existing lines as desired.

    <p>
    To add a keyword specification, one selects the desired keyword in
    the keywords menu of the editor.  The available keywords are
    listed in the drop-down menu, and the set available depends on the
    class tab currently selected.  After clicking on a keyword in the
    menu, the user will be asked to enter the associated text in the
    prompt line, if the keyword requires it.  The keyword will be
    applied internally and appear in the listing if there are no
    errors.  A status message will appear, indicating success, or
    providing an error message.

    <p>
    When adding a keyword, redundant and inconsistent keywords that
    are already in the list, such as a previous instance of the
    keyword, are removed.  In other cases, a pop-up message will
    appear if inconsistent keywords are found.

    <p>
    Clicking on a line in the listing will select the line.  The text
    for the selected line can be edited, or the line deleted, with the
    <b>Edit</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons in the editor's <b>Edit</b>
    menu.  The <b>Edit</b> menu also contains an <b>Undo</b> button,
    allowing the last operation to be undone.
!!LATEX xic:lpedt attrmenu.tex
The {\cb Edit Tech Params} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu} brings
up the {\cb Tech Parameter Editor}.  The editor can also be displayed
by clicking on a layer in the layer table or layer palette with button
3 while holding down the {\kb Shift} and {\kb Ctrl} keys.  The current
layer will become the clicked-on layer, and it will become the target
layer for the editor.

From the editor, many of the technology file keywords, mostly
associated with layers, can have their specifications added, deleted,
or edited.  Keywords that are not adjustable in the editor have an
alternate means of control, such as the separate panels for setting
layer colors and fill patterns.  After modification, the {\cb Save
Tech} button in the {\cb Attributes Menu} can be used to generate a
new technology file that incorporates the changes.

The present editor applies to all keywords.  In earlier {\Xic}
releases, there were separate keyword editors in the {\cb Extract} and
{\cb Convert} menus, as well as an editor in the {\cb Attributes
Menu}.  The different keyword classes, previously available in
separate editors, are now available by selecting one of the four tabs
at the top of the editor window.  Each of these keywords is normally
applied to a layer in the technology file.

The editor is configured for the class of keywords selected, meaning
that the pull-down menu contains entries for those keywords, and the
listing details those keywords only.  The classes, and keywords that
can be manipulated, are listed below.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Layer}\\
These are miscellaneous layer attributes, as described in \ref{misclattr}.

\item{\cb Extract}\\
These are parameters that are used by the extraction system, but have
relevance elsewhere, such as in the cross section viewer.  These
keywords are described in \ref{exkwords}.
\begin{quote} \vt
Conductor\\
Routing\\
GroundPlane\\
GroundPlaneClear\\
Contact\\
Via\\

\end{quote}

\item{\cb Physical}\\
These generally set a physical property of the layer material,
primarily in support of the extraction system.  These keywords are
described in \ref{phkwords}.
\begin{quote} \vt
Planarize\\
Thickness\\
Rho\\

Rsh\\
EpsRel\\

\end{quote}

\item{\cb Convert}\\

and GDSII layer and datatype numbers, as described in \ref{convlattr}.
\begin{quote} \vt

\end{quote}
\end{description}

In addition to the per-layer keywords, there is a {\cb Global
Attributes} menu that allows a few miscellaneous non-layer parameters
to be manipulated.  These were defined as technology file parameters
in {\Xic} releases earlier than 4.1.7.  In present releases, these are
simply variables.  The editor provides a ``front end'' for setting the

{\cb DRC Menu}.  When the editor first appears, the keyword
specifications for the current layer in the selected class are listed. 
The specifications appear as they would in the technology file. 
Changing the current layer will update the listing to the parameters

    When the <b>Freeze Display</b> button in the <b>Main Window</b>
    sub-menu of the <b>Attributes Menu</b> or the <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-window</a> <b>Attributes</b> menu is active,
    no cell structure is drawn in the window, only the grid and the
    cell bounding box.  This is for use when working on a large,
    complex design when it is not necessary to see the structure and
    it is inconvenient to wait for the display.  When active, "FROZEN"
    appears in the upper left corner of the window.

    <p>
    In a frozen window, certain other highlighting features may
    appear.  In particular <a href=xic:ruler>rulers</a> and the
    viewport location indicators as used by the <a
    href="xic:lshow"><b>Show Location</b></a> function will be
    displayed.  Also, the outlines of selected objects will appear in
    these windows.

    <p>
    Frozen <a href="xic:vport">sub-windows</a> have an additional
    feature:  frozen sub-windows display the viewport of the main
    window, the reverse of the <b>Show Location</b> function for
    sub-windows (which displays sub-window viewports in the main
    window). 

    <p>
    This allows a useful trick for viewing huge cells.  Suppose that
    one has a large design which takes a long time to render, and one
    wishes to examine a small part of this design (the approximate
    coordinates are known).  One can employ the following procedure. 
    Freeze the main window and read in the design.  Bring up a
    sub-window by clicking twice outside of the cell boundary, so that
    the sub-window is empty.  Freeze the sub-window, then press the
    <b>Home</b> key with the cursor in the sub-window to center and
    fully view the top cell boundary.  Use the grid and/or rulers to
    determine the region of interest.  Drag with <a
    href="button3">button 3</a> to define a rectangle in the sub-window
    surrounding the region of interest, then click with button 3 in
    the center of the main window.  Un-freeze the main window, and
    this region will be displayed.  The region shown in the main
    window is shown with a dotted yellow outline in the frozen
    sub-window.

The {\cb Cell Name True Orient} button in the {\cb Main Window}
sub-menu of the {\cb Attributes Menu} or the sub-window {\cb
Attributes} menu is sensitive when cell names are being displayed in
unexpanded instances (the {\cb Show Cell Names} button is active). 
When set, the name text is transformed in the same way as the subcell. 
When not set, the name text is always shown in a ``legible''
orientation.  It is sometimes convenient to invoke this option, as one
can see at a glance which subcells are rotated, mirrored, etc.

    <b>Keyword</b>: <tt>grid</tt>

    <p>
    The <b>Set Grid</b> button in the <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b> or the <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-window</a> <b>Attributes</b> menu brings up
    the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel.  Pressing <a
    href="keyctrlg"><b>Ctrl-g</b></a> when a drawing window has
    keyboard focus will also produce this panel.  The panel provides
    control of the grid display in the associated drawing window. 
    Separate grid styles are available for electrical and physical
    mode, and in the main drawing window when the <b>Print Control
    Panel</b> is visible.

    <p>
    The panel is divided into two pages:  <b>Snapping</b> and
    <b>Style</b>.  The <b>Snapping</b> page is shown when the panel
    first appears.  It provides control of the grid spacing and
    snapping, plus is the main control point for the edge snapping
    feature to be described.  The <b>Style</b> page provides control
    over the visual presentation of the grid.

    <p>
    In most cases, the grid is not actually changed unless/until the
    <b>Apply</b> button, at the bottom-left of the panel, is pressed. 
    This is not true of the <b>Edge Snapping</b> group, or the <b>All
    Windows</b> controls in the <b>Style</b> page, which work
    immediately, but do not force a screen redraw.

    <p>
    The following controls appear in the <b>Snapping</b> page.

    <p>
    At the top of the panel are entries which control the grid spacing
    and snapping.  There is a coarse grid, and a fine grid, that may
    be displayed in drawing windows and hard-copy output.  The coarse
    grid is an integer multiple of fine grid increments, the
    multiplier can be set from the <b>Style</b> page.  If a grid would
    be too fine, it is not shown.

    <p>
    The snap grid represents points where the cursor is allowed to
    reside.  These are related to the fine grid interval, there can
    be an integer number of snap points per fine grid interval, or an
    integer number of fine grid lines between snap points.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Snap Spacing</b><dd>
    The <b>Snap Spacing</b> entry area will set the spacing, in
    microns, between snap points.  The mouse pointer is constrained to
    fall only on snap points when geometry is being created.  If the
    <a href="MfgGrid"><tt>MfgGrid</tt></a> parameter has been set in
    the technology file, the <b>Snap Spacing</b> value is constrained
    to be a multiple of this value.  The <tt>MfgGrid</tt> value is
    printed below the text entry area if set, or the word
    "<tt>unset</tt>" is printed if not.

    <p>
    The <b>Snap Spacing</b> entry displays the actual snap spacing in
    microns.  If a <tt>MfgGrid</tt> has been defined, and one enters a
    snap spacing that is not an integer multiple of this value, the
    actual snap spacing will "snap" to the closest multiple before
    use.

    <p>
    When assigning a <tt>MfgGrid</tt>, one must consider the internal
    resolution, and the <tt>MfgGrid</tt> should be representable in
    the resolution in use.  For example, the default resolution is
    1000 per micron, or 1nm.  If one attempts to use a
    <tt>MfgGrid</tt> of 2.5nm, round-off error will occur.  To support
    this <tt>MfgGrid</tt>, a resolution of 2000 would be required. 
    The resolution is set with the <a
    href="DatabaseResolution"><b>DatabaseResolution</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    When the panel first appears, the initial keyboard focus is to the
    <b>Snap Spacing</b> entry.  Thus, text typed will go to this
    entry.  Pressing <b>Enter</b> when a text entry has the focus
    calls the <b>Apply</b> callback and sets focus to the
    <b>Dismiss</b> button, where another <b>Enter</b> press will
    dismiss the panel.  So, to quickly change the grid spacing from
    the keyboard only, one can type
    <blockquote>
    <b>Ctrl-g</b> (adjust number) <b>Enter Enter</b>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>SnapPerGrid</b> or <b>GridPerSnap</b><dd>
    To the right is another text entry, which accepts an integer in
    the range 1-10.  The entry label indicates <b>SnapPerGrid</b> or
    <b>GridPerSnap</b>, depending on whether the <b>GridPerSnap</b>
    check box, below the text entry, is checked.  This controls the
    placement of the fine grid lines in the window.

    <p>
    If the label indicates <b>SnapPerGrid</b>, then the fine grid is
    spaced at the given integer times the <b>Snap Spacing</b> value. 
    For example, if the integer is 3, then a fine grid line (or dot)
    will be drawn at every third snap point.  there will be three snap
    points per fine grid interval.

    <p>
    If the label indicates <b>GridPerSnap</b>, then the fine grid is
    spaced such that the integer will give the number of fine grid
    lines per snap interval.  For example, it the integer is 3, fine
    grid lines (or dots) will appear at the snap points, as well as
    the 1/3 and 2/3 proportional distances between snap points.

    <p>
    Note that when the integer is 1, there is no difference between
    the two cases.

    <p>
    In electrical mode, the snap interval should be a multiple of one
    micron, to avoid connectivity errors due to numerical roundoff. 
    However, this was not enforced in older releases of <i>Xic</i>. 
    Presently, sub-micron snapping on tenth-micron intervals is
    accepted, but with a warning issued.  This allows older files to
    be "repaired", i.e., objects moved to a one micron grid.  This is
    recommended for files that require it.  A sub-micron snapping
    interval should not be used otherwise, and will not be saved in
    the technology file produced with the <a href="xic:updat"><b>Save
    Tech</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The <b>Edge Snapping</b> group appears below the grid snapping
    controls.  This is different from grid snapping.  The edge
    snapping will snap the cursor to the edge of a nearby object,
    which may or may not be off grid ("off grid" means that the
    coordinate is not on a multiple of the snap grid interval).  The
    edge snapping is used in, and the controls apply to, physical mode
    only.  In electrical mode, the cursor will always snap to and
    indicate when near a connection point.

    <p>
    When snapped in this manner to an edge, a small dotted box
    transiently appears around the mouse pointer.  If snapped to
    vertex of an object, the box will have a double outline.

    <p>
    Snapping will apply to visible objects at any level of the cell
    hierarchy.  The edges of unexpanded subcells will also be snapped
    to.

    <p>
    The group consists of an <b>Edge Snapping</b> menu, and four check
    boxes, as described below.  These may be set independently in the
    main window and <a href="xic:vport">sub-windows</a>.  When a new
    sub-window appears, it will inherit the edge snapping settings
    from the main window, but these can then be changed in the
    sub-window if desired.

    <p>
    Unlike other controls in the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel, these
    controls operate immediately.  They do not require pressing the
    <b>Apply</b> button.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Edge Snapping Menu</b><dd>
    The menu has three choices, to set the scope of the edge snapping mode.
    If <b>DISABLED</b> is selected, then there is no edge snapping in the
    window.  The default entry, <b>Enabled in some commands</b>, enables
    the edge snapping in commands where it may be useful.  These include
    the side menu commands with the following keywords:
    <blockquote>

    as well as the <a href="xic:ruler"><b>Rulers</b></a> command in the
    <b>View Menu</b>.

    <p>
    The third choice is <b>Enabled always</b>, which provides the edge
    snapping at all times, in commands or outside of any command.

    <dt><b>Allow off-grid edge snapping</b><dd>
    When this check box is checked, the cursor will snap to nearby
    edges, whether or not they are on grid.  When not checked, only
    snapping to on-grid locations is done.  This is unchecked
    by default.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include non-Manhattan edges</b><dd>
    When checked, non-Manhattan (meaning not horizontal or vertical)
    edges will be snapped to.  The snap points are the intersection of
    the snap grid and the edge, plus the endpoints (vertices).  If not
    checked, non-Manhattan edges are not snapped to.  This is unchecked
    by default.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include wire edges</b><dd>
    If checked, the edges of wires are considered for edge snapping.
    If not checked, wire edges are ignored.  This mode is enabled by
    default.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Include wire path</b><dd>
    A wire definition consists of a sequence of vertices, with an
    implied line path connecting them.  This path would appear as a
    line running along the center of a drawn wire.  When this box is
    checked, the wire path is considered for "edge" snapping.  By
    default, this box is unchecked, so that the wire path is not
    snapped to.

    <dt><b>Store</b> and <b>Recall</b><dd>
    The <b>Store</b> and <b>Recall</b> menus allow a set of grid
    parameters to be saved in an internal register, to be recalled as
    needed.  There are separate physical and electrical grid
    registers.  One will automatically save to and recall from the
    register associated with the window display mode.

    <p>
    The grid registers save all per-window parameters that can be set
    from the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel.  There are seven registers
    available, as indicated on the menu produced by the <b>Store</b>
    button.  The <b>Recall</b> button produces a menu with two
    additional entries:

    <dl>
    <dt><b>revert</b><dd>
    Revert the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel to the current window settings.
    </dl>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>last appl</b><dd>
    Recall the last settings that were applied with the <b>Apply</b>
    button.
    </dl>

    Grid registers are saved to the technology file when a technology
    file is written, and are loaded when a technology file is read.

    <p>
    See also the description of the <a href="!rg"><b>!rg</b></a> and

    choices are <b>No Axes</b>, <b>Plain Axes</b>, and <b>Mark
    Origin</b>.  The <b>Mark Origin</b> choice is the default.  The
    <b>Plain Axes</b> choice does away with the small box at the
    origin, showing the axes as simple lines.  The <b>No Axes</b>
    choice suppresses the axes entirely.  In electrical mode, the axes
    are always suppressed.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Coarse Mult</b><dd>
    To the right of the radio group is an integer entry for the coarse
    multiple.  This is the number of fine grid lines or dots per
    coarse grid line or dot.  Acceptable values are 1 through 50. 
    When set to one, the coarse grid replaces the fine grid, which is
    shown with the coarse grid color.  The default value is 5.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Line Style Editor</b><dd>
    This group sets the line or dot style used to render the grid. 
    There are three "radio buttons", <b>Solid</b>, <b>Dots</b>, and
    <b>Textured</b> that set the basic grid style.  Choosing
    <b>Solid</b> will cause the grid to use continuous lines.  The
    <b>Dots</b> option will use a grid consisting of a small dot or
    cross at each grid point.  When this selection is active, a
    <b>Cross Size</b> entry area appears.  This can be set to values
    0-6, indicating the number of pixels to light up around the
    central dot in the four compass directions.  If zero, only the
    central pixel is lit, which can be difficult to see on
    high-resolution displays.  The value 1 generally looks like a much
    brighter dot.  Larger values will appear as a small cross.

    <p>
    If <b>Textured</b> is chosen, a user-specified patterned line will
    be used, and the line style editing areas become visible.  The
    line style editor allows the user to specify the patterning of the
    lines used to form the grid.  The upper window is a sample of the
    current line style.  The lower window allows the user to set the
    line style by clicking.

    <p>
    The line pattern starts at the left set bit (blue area) and
    extends to the right of the display.  The pattern is used to
    "tile" the line.  The left part of the display is shown in gray to
    indicate that it is not part of the line style mask.  Clicking in
    this window with button 1 will toggle the bit.  Button 2 will
    clear the bit, and button 3 will set the bit.  Multiple bits can
    be set or toggled by dragging.  The line in the preview window
    will reflect changes in the pattern.

    <p>
    The sample window is a drag source for a piece of text giving the
    line style mask in <tt>0x</tt><i>hhhh</i> (hexadecimal) notation.
    The mask is the integer being represented by the lower window, with
    set bits in blue.  This may be useful for creating line styles for
    entry elsewhere.

    operate immediately without the need to press the <b>Apply</b> button,
    however an explicit screen redraw is necessary to see the effect.

    <p>
    The <b>No coarse when fine invisible</b> check box applies in
    physical mode only.  When the check box is not checked, as one
    zooms out, when the fine grid becomes too closely spaced it won't
    be shown, however the coarse grid will be shown, unless it too is
    too finely spaced.  If the check box is checked, the coarse grid
    will not be shown by itself, it will be suppressed when the fine
    grid is suppressed.  This tracks the state (set or unset) of the
    <a href="GridNoCoarseOnly"><b>GridNoCoarseOnly</b></a> variable.

    <p>
    The <b>Visibility Threshold</b> entry sets the minimum number of
    pixels between grid lines or dots.  The grid will be suppressed if

up the {\cb Grid Setup} panel.  Pressing {\kb Ctrl-g} when a drawing
window has keyboard focus will also produce this panel.  The panel
provides control of the grid display in the associated drawing window. 
Separate grid styles are available for electrical and physical mode,
and in the main drawing window when the {\cb Print Control Panel} is
visible.

The panel is divided into two pages:  {\cb Snapping} and {\cb Style}. 
The {\cb Snapping} page is shown when the panel first appears.  It
provides control of the grid spacing and snapping, plus is the main
control point for the edge snapping feature to be described.  The {\cb
Style} page provides control over the visual presentation of the grid.

In most cases, the grid is not actually changed unless/until the {\cb

not true of the {\cb Edge Snapping} group, or the {\cb All Windows}
controls in the {\cb Style} page, which work immediately, but do not
force a screen redraw.

The following controls appear in the {\cb Snapping} page.

At the top of the panel are entries which control the grid spacing and
snapping.  There is a coarse grid, and a fine grid, that may be
displayed in drawing windows and hard-copy output.  The coarse grid is
an integer multiple of fine grid increments, the multiplier can be set
from the {\cb Style} page.  If a grid would be too fine, it is not
shown.

The snap grid represents points where the cursor is allowed to reside. 
These are related to the fine grid interval, there can be an integer
number of snap points per fine grid interval, or an integer number of
fine grid lines between snap points.

\begin{description}
\index{MfgGrid keyword}
\index{DatabaseResolution variable}
\item{\cb Snap Spacing}\\
The {\cb Snap Spacing} entry area will set the spacing, in microns,
between snap points.  The mouse pointer is constrained to fall only on
snap points when geometry is being created.  If the {\et MfgGrid}
parameter has been set in the technology file, the {\cb Snap Spacing}
value is constrained to be a multiple of this value.  The {\et
MfgGrid} value is printed below the text entry area if set, or the
word ``{\vt unset}'' is printed if not.

The {\cb Snap Spacing} entry displays the actual snap spacing in
microns.  If a {\vt MfgGrid} has been defined, and one enters a snap
spacing that is not an integer multiple of this value, the actual snap
spacing will ``snap'' to the closest multiple before use.

When assigning a {\vt MfgGrid}, one must consider the internal
resolution, and the {\vt MfgGrid} should be representable in the
resolution in use.  For example, the default resolution is 1000 per
micron, or 1nm.  If one attempts to use a {\vt MfgGrid} of 2.5nm,
round-off error will occur.  To support this {\vt MfgGrid}, a
resolution of 2000 would be required.  The resolution is set with the
{\et DatabaseResolution} variable.

When the panel first appears, the initial keyboard focus is to the
{\cb Snap Spacing} entry.  Thus, text typed will go to this entry. 
Pressing {\kb Enter} when a text entry has the focus calls the {\cb
Apply} callback and sets focus to the {\cb Dismiss} button, where
another {\cb Enter} press will dismiss the panel.  So, to quickly
change the grid spacing from the keyboard only, one can type

\begin{quote}
{\kb Ctrl-g} (adjust number) {\kb Enter Enter}
\end{quote}

\item{\cb SnapPerGrid} or {\cb GridPerSnap}\\
To the right is another text entry, which accepts an integer in the
range 1--10.  The entry label indicates {\cb SnapPerGrid} or {\cb
GridPerSnap}, depending on whether the {\cb GridPerSnap} check box,
below the text entry, is checked.  This controls the placement of the
fine grid lines in the window.

If the label indicates {\cb SnapPerGrid}, then the fine grid is spaced
at the given integer times the {\cb Snap Spacing} value.  For example,
if the integer is 3, then a fine grid line (or dot) will be drawn at
every third snap point.  there will be three snap points per fine grid
interval.

If the label indicates {\cb GridPerSnap}, then the fine grid is spaced
such that the integer will give the number of fine grid lines per snap
interval.  For example, it the integer is 3, fine grid lines (or dots)
will appear at the snap points, as well as the 1/3 and 2/3
proportional distances between snap points.

Note that when the integer is 1, there is no difference between the
two cases.

In electrical mode, the snap interval should be a multiple of one
micron, to avoid connectivity errors due to numerical roundoff. 
However, this was not enforced in older releases of {\Xic}. 
Presently, sub-micron snapping on tenth-micron intervals is accepted,
but with a warning issued.  This allows older files to be
``repaired'', i.e., objects moved to a one micron grid.  This is
recommended for files that require it.  A sub-micron snapping interval
should not be used otherwise, and will not be saved in the technology
file produced with the {\cb Save Tech} button in the {\cb Attributes
Menu}.

The {\cb Edge Snapping} group appears below the grid snapping
controls.  This is different from grid snapping.  The edge snapping
will snap the cursor to the edge of a nearby object, which may or may
not be off grid (``off grid'' means that the coordinate is not on a
multiple of the snap grid interval).  The edge snapping is used in,
and the controls apply to, physical mode only.  In electrical mode,
the cursor will always snap to and indicate when near a connection
point.

When snapped in this manner to an edge, a small dotted box transiently
appears around the mouse pointer.  If snapped to vertex of an object,
the box will have a double outline.

Snapping will apply to visible objects at any level of the cell
hierarchy.  The edges of unexpanded subcells will also be snapped to.

The group consists of an {\cb Edge Snapping} menu, and four check
boxes, as described below.  These may be set independently in the main
window and sub-windows.  When a new sub-window appears, it will
inherit the edge snapping settings from the main window, but these can
then be changed in the sub-window if desired.

Unlike other controls in the {\cb Grid Setup} panel, these controls
operate immediately.  They do not require pressing the {\cb Apply}
button.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Edge Snapping Menu}\\
The menu has three choices, to set the scope of the edge snapping
mode.  If {\cb DISABLED} is selected, then there is no edge snapping
in the window.  The default entry, {\cb Enabled in some commands},
enables the edge snapping in commands where it may be useful.  These
include the side menu commands with the following keywords:

\begin{quote} \vt
arc\\
box\\
break\\
donut\\
erase\\
polyg\\
round\\
wire\\
xor
\end{quote}

as well as the {\cb Rulers} command in the {\cb View Menu}.

The third choice is {\cb Enabled always}, which provides the edge
snapping at all times, in commands or outside of any command.

\item{\cb Allow off-grid edge snapping}\\
When this check box is checked, the cursor will snap to nearby edges,
whether or not they are on grid.  When not checked, only snapping to
on-grid locations is done.  This is unchecked by default.

\item{\cb Include non-Manhattan edges}\\
When checked, non-Manhattan (meaning not horizontal or vertical) edges
will be snapped to.  The snap points are the intersection of the snap
grid and the edge, plus the endpoints (vertices).  If not checked,
non-Manhattan edges ar not snapped to.  This is unchecked by default.

\item{\cb Include wire edges}\\
If checked, the edges of wires are considered for edge snapping.  If
not checked, wire edges are ignored.  This mode is enabled by default.

\item{\cb Include wire path}\\
A wire definition consists of a sequence of vertices, with an implied
line path connecting them.  This path would appear as a line running
along the center of a drawn wire.  When this box is checked, the wire
path is considered for ``edge'' snapping.  By default, this box is
unchecked, so that the wire path is not snapped to.
\end{description}

The {\cb Style} page contains controls which alter the presentation of
the grid visually.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Show}\\
If the {\cb Show} button is active, the grid will be visible when
gradations are adequately large.  Otherwise, the grid will not be
visible in the window.

\item{\cb On Top}\\
If the {\cb On Top} button is active, the grid will be drawn last,
after all geometry.  Otherwise, it will be drawn first, in which case
it is more likely to be obscured by the geometry.

\item{\cb Store} and {\cb Recall}\\
The {\cb Store} and {\cb Recall} menus allow a set of grid parameters
to be saved in an internal register, to be recalled as needed.  There
are separate physical and electrical grid registers.  One will
automatically save to and recall from the register associated with the
window display mode.

The grid registers save all per-window parameters that can be set from
the {\cb Grid Setup} panel.  There are seven registers available, as
indicated on the menu produced by the {\cb Store} button.  The {\cb
Recall} button produces a menu with two additional entries:

\begin{description}
\item{\cb revert}\\
Revert the {\cb Grid Setup} panel to the current window settings.

\item{\cb last appl}\\
Recall the last settings that were applied with the {\cb Apply}
button.
\end{description}

Grid registers are saved to the technology file when a technology file
is written, and are loaded when a technology file is read.

See also the description of the {\cb !rg} and {\cb !sg} commands. 
These can be used to save and restore the grid from registers.

\item{\cb Axes} group\\
Below the {\cb Show} button, a radio button group is provided to set
the presentation style of the axes in physical mode.  The choices are
{\cb No Axes}, {\cb Plain Axes}, and {\cb Mark Origin}.  The {\cb Mark
Origin} choice is the default.  The {\cb Plain Axes} choice does away
with the small box at the origin, showing the axes as simple lines. 
The {\cb No Axes} choice suppresses the axes entirely.  In electrical
mode, the axes are always suppressed.

\item{\cb Coarse Mult}\\
To the right of the radio group is an integer entry for the coarse
multiple.  This is the number of fine grid lines or dots per coarse
grid line or dot.  Acceptable values are 1 through 50.  When set to
one, the coarse grid replaces the fine grid, which is shown with the
coarse grid color.  The default value is 5.

\item{\cb Line Style Editor}\\
This group sets the line or dot style used to render the grid.  There
are three ``radio buttons'', {\cb Solid}, {\cb Dots}, and {\cb
Textured} that set the basic grid style.  Choosing {\cb Solid} will
cause the grid to use continuous lines.  The {\cb Dots} option will
use a grid consisting of a small dot or cross at each grid point. 
When this selection is active, a {\cb Cross Size} entry area appears. 
This can be set to values 0--6, indicating the number of pixels to
light up around the central dot in the four compass directions.  If
zero, only the central pixel is lit, which can be difficult to see on
high-resolution displays.  The value 1 generally looks like a much
brighter dot.  Larger values will appear as a small cross.

If {\cb Textured} is chosen, a user-specified patterned line will be
used, and the line style editing areas become visible.  The line style
editor allows the user to specify the patterning of the lines used to
form the grid.  The upper window is a sample of the current line
style.  The lower window allows the user to set the line style by
clicking.

The line pattern starts at the left set bit (blue area) and extends to
the right of the display.  The pattern is used to ``tile'' the line. 
The left part of the display is shown in gray to indicate that it is
not part of the line style mask.  Clicking in this window with button
1 will toggle the bit.  Button 2 will clear the bit, and button 3 will
set the bit.  Multiple bits can be set or toggled by dragging.  The
line in the preview window will reflect changes in the pattern.

The sample window is a drag source for a piece of text giving the line
style mask in {\vt 0x}{\it hhhh} (hexadecimal) notation.  The mask is
the integer being represented by the lower window, with set bits in
blue.  This may be useful for creating line styles for entry
elsewhere.

\item{\cb All Windows}\\
This control group appears only in the {\cb Grid Setup} panel for the
main drawing window.  The two controls in the group are different from
other controls in the panel in that they apply globally to all drawing
windows.  They also differ from other controls in that they operate
immediately without the need to press the {\cb Apply} button, however
an explicit screen redraw is necessary to see the effect.

The {\cb No coarse when fine invisible} check box applies in physical
mode only.  When the check box is not checked, as one zooms out, when
the fine grid becomes too closely spaced it won't be shown, however
the coarse grid will be shown, unless it too is too finely spaced.  If
the check box is checked, the coarse grid will not be shown by itself,
it will be suppressed when the fine grid is suppressed.  This tracks
the state (set or unset) of the {\et GridNoCoarseOnly} variable.

The {\cb Visibility Threshold} entry sets the minimum number of pixels
between grid lines or dots.  The grid will be suppressed if it would
be smaller.  This applies to all drawing windows, both physical and
electrical.  This tracks the setting of the {\et GridThreshold}
variable.
\end{description}

Pressing the {\cb Apply} button will actually save the new grid
parameters in {\Xic}, and redraw the window if something has changed. 
Changes in the {\cb Edge Snapping} and {\cb All Windows} groups do not
need the {\cb Apply} button, changes take effect immediately.  All
other controls require an {\cb Apply} button press to assert the
change, and changes will {\bf not} be saved unless {\cb Apply} is
pressed.
