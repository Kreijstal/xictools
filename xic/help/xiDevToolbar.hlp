Terminal Device
!!HTML
    The <b>tbar</b>, <b>tblk</b>, <b>ttri</b>, and <b>txbox</b> are
    "terminal devices" from the default device library.  These devices
    behave identically, and differ only in appearance.  Each device
    has an associated label (with text defaulting to the device name)
    which can be changed by the user by selecting the label and
    pressing the <a href="xic:label"><b>label</b></a> button in the
    side menu.  The label will supply a name, which will be applied to
    a connected net.  All nets connected to a terminal device with the
    same name are taken as being connected together.

    <p>
    This will not tie nets between the main circuit and subcircuits,
    or between subcircuits, unless the terminal name is also a <a
    href="globname">global</a> net name.  If not global, the scope is
    within the cell only.

    <p>
    Internally, the device will reconfigure itself as a scalar or
    multi-contact device according to the label.  Older <i>Xic</i>
    releases provided a <b>tbus</b> terminal, which is no longer
    compatible.

    <p>
    The name applied to a net via a terminal device is handled
    identically to a name obtained from a <a href="wirelabel">wire

    selected into mutual inductor pairs.

    <p>
    When the <b>mut</b> device is selected, an existing pair of
    coupled inductors (if any have been defined) is shown highlighted,
    and the SPICE coupling factor printed.  The arrow keys cycle
    through the internal list of coupled inductor pairs, or a pair may
    be selected by clicking on one of the inductors or the coefficient
    label with button 1.  At any time, pressing the '<b>a</b>' key
    will allow addition of a mutual inductor pair.  The same effect is

    user is asked to click on the two coupled inductors (if '<b>a</b>'
    entered or there are no existing mutual inductors), or the second
    inductor (if the user clicked on an inductor), and then to enter
    the coupling factor.  The coupling factor can be any string, so as
    to allow shell variable expansion in <i>WRspice</i>, but if it
    parses as a number it must be in the range between -1 and 1. 

    <p>
    Pressing the '<b>d</b>' key will delete the mutual inductance

    <p>
    Pressing the '<b>k</b>' key will prompt for a new value of the

    on the coefficient label in a drawing window.  When entering the
    coefficient string, one can enter either the form
    <i>name</i>=<i>coef_string</i>, or simply the coefficient string. 
    In the first case, the <i>name</i> will provide an alternate fixed
    name for the mutual inductor in SPICE output.  This can be any
    alphanumeric name, but should start with 'k' or 'K' for SPICE.  If
    no name is given, <i>Xic</i> will assign a name consisting of
    <tt>K</tt> followed by a unique index integer.

    <p>
    One can also change the coefficient string and/or name with the <a

    the label text can have either of the forms described above.

The {\et nmos} device is an n-channel MOSFET variation that contains
three visible nodes (drain, gate, source).  The bulk node is connected
to an internal global node named ``NSUB''.  To use this device, the
circuit should contain a voltage source tied to a terminal device with
label ``NSUB'' to provide substrate bias to all devices of this type. 
This simplifies the schematic by hiding the substrate connection to
each transistor.
